# How is the overall CI/CD Drupal workflow put together?

The intent of the Platform.sh continuous integration and deployment with Lando repository is to use it as a 'grab and go' starting point.  The README on the repository itself aims to provide the instructions for quickly using it.  However, as versions change, as you might be looking to start from a Windows or Linux machine rather than a Mac, as you prefer to consider DDEV or Docksal instead of Lando, you may need to know the underlying details so you can make any adaptions.  The process behind the underpinnings of the repository and the code modification, starting modules additions, etc. are outlined in detail in this GitHub pages hosted companion site.
