# Flagging

### Anchor Links
Some people think of flags as an option within CKeditor that allows you to mark some specific link location on a page somewhere in your website.  That is no surprising since you use the little flag symbol in the editor.  If you are familiar with "markup" like is used in building this site hosted on GitHub Pages, the concept is the same as [Name](directory/page#location).

### Flag Module
Another way people think of flags is 'to report something' such as flagging an offensive post.  The [Flag Module](https://www.drupal.org/project/flag) is also used for a user to flag something to read later or as a favorite, much like "bookmarking" an entry.  There are dozens of uses that you can spinoff of this basic concept and, though dated, the [Flag Module Documentation](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/modules/flag) overviews many.

The Drupal version used in this [overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1okegMnDxAE) is way out of date, but it still gives a pretty quick general idea about the module.
