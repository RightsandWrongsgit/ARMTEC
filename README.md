GitHub Pages Site for Technical Support Division

This site offers the documentation for a Drupal CI/CD Workflow Base Project under a separate repository  under this same user account called "initial-test-of-platform-ci-with-lando".  The documentation is separate for two reasons:

- That repository involves support of a multi-branch workflow and it is preferred NOT to have a gh-pages branch underneath it to avoid confusion.

- This separate repository also includes extensive background to support a novice user with basics; either directly, or through provided links on documentation pages.
