# Open Source Solutions

Discover a plethora of amazing free tools, ranging from locally installed software to browser-based ones. ARMTEC has handpicked some favorites. Remember, if you love and use an Open Source tool, give back to the community in any way you can, not just technically.

## Office Suite:

You may already have something from Microsoft or Apple that you got when you bought your computer.  These are great.  There is an open source alternative Office Suite for documents, drawings, spreadsheets, database, and even for formulas that you might want to use.

## Design Your Site:

It is pretty much standard practice to design your first website using some sort of easy tools before you start actually programming it.  You might go through this in steps with increasing levels of sophistication.  A napkin at the bar isn't off the table as a first level option.  Pencil and pad are pretty easy to rough something out and change.  You might move to a drawing tool in your Office Suite to make something to show others and get a first reaction.  The pictures your use in your mockup might come from free internet images, your own camera, or illustrations you do.  Here are some options to look at -

## YOU & Open Source

ARMTEC strongly supports [Open Source tools,](../book/opensource.md) where people contribute their time to create resources that are freely accessible to the public. In return, you can give back to the Open Source community by donating your time, resources, or skills. You don't have to be a programming genius to get involved - if you have a talent for simplifying complex topics, you can make a valuable contribution. In fact, you are probably just what Open Source software developers need...

<br>

ARMTEC believes that Open Source tools are not just about big software systems, but also about filling gaps in knowledge and helping people understand how to bring different parts together.  ARMTEC believes that Open Source business concepts are just as important as computer code. While this site is our personal resource collection, we welcome others to access and benefit from it. If it helps you meet your needs, great! And if it sparks your interest in working with practical experts, feel free to reach out to us.
