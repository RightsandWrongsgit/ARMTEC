# Purchase Intent

## Measurement

The key to measuring purchase intent is to assure a proper stimulus.  In an ideal fantasy world this would be the actual product with full explanation of all use benefits clearly elaborated and a price with any adjustments provided.  With a new product we back down from that and show a fully developed advertisement or even a concept statement; but we never back down from showing the price.  This is because [price elasticity](../business/priceelasticity.md) is likely an important decision influence is intent choice.  In more sophisticated research we often include multiple price points being tested, any price discounting actions like coupons, BOGOs, etc. We even can consider using filter questions for store location adjustments by asking respondents their typical shopping aisle section visit behaviors.

What we ask after showing the stimulus is an intent to purchase question with this type of response scale.<br>

## Top Two Box

It is common for organizations to establish hurdle rates for what percent of the survey respondents answer in the Very or Probably will buy [Top Two Box answers](https://help.honestly.com/knowledge/how-your-scores-are-calculated-top2-vs.-average).  In fact, this can be an important criteria in a [Stage Gate](https://slidemodel.com/stage-gate-process-for-product-development/) decision to proceed process.   That may make sense for an organization which has an organization advantage or skill in distribution through the Food/Drug/Mass Merchandise channels to a general population buyer set which they can't sort out very easily at point of purchase.  However, for many other types of businesses they have the potential to more directly speak to and deliver to highly targeted populations.  In those types of businesses it makes more sense to include very carefully considered demographic and list source targeting questions in the survey of purchase intent and simply align the top intent to purchase questions to these.  Then you create an advertising and promotion strategy aimed effectively and efficiently at the most receptive.

## Revenue Projection

So you think you can just take the percent of people who say they will buy times the count from the underlying [potential](../business/potential.md) times the  price of what you offer and project your revenue.  Then conclude "I will be RICH".  

Time to burst your bubble.  A couple things get in the way of that simple logic.

### Lie Factor

There is a hint of an issue from the fact we ask a five level purchase intent question; people who say "definitely" must count more than the "probably".  Yeah, well in the real world not even all of the "definitely" people will actually make a purchase.  We can conclude that people lie on surveys...  

It is actually pretty interesting that the follow-through rate from these purchase intent answers differs by country and product category.  Think about the stories you have heard about how different people from various countries show difference in how polite they are.  Some groups regard telling you that your product kind of sucks as being impolite and the response scale in such countries scales up to higher intent to purchase but less follow-through.  There are also differences by category because some things are considered more personally sensitive than others.  It is one thing to tell someone their beautiful lipstick is nasty versus indicating I simply am not a fan of spicy food.  Don't believe this?  There is a company who has made a whole business model out of [establishing adjustment norms by country & category.](https://www.ashokcharan.com/Marketing-Analytics/~pv-BASES.php#gsc.tab=0)

So what do you do if country/category norms aren't available for the type of good or service you plan to offer.  Our starting point is that about 86% of those who answer that they will 'definitely' buy will follow-through in the real world.  Of those who say they 'probably' will buy we would apply the follow-through rate of only 29%.  The 'might or might not', 'probably not' and 'definitely not' are given zero's for actual purchase estimation.  Sometimes we aim to tighten up these general adjustment factors by injecting an internal study norming approach in the study design.  This requires for also accounting for the other factors discussed below in our modeling; including awareness measurement within the survey and having sources for actual distribution.  The basic logic is to include an existing product(s) in the same survey as the new product and work the simulated test market model backward to match the known sales of the existing product.  The key to the math solution is that those answering ‘definitely’ will be valued with a three fold weight factor compared to ‘probably’ respondents. This recognizes the relative strength of commitment to actual purchase seen from survey intent to purchase statement responses.

### Know about it

You have to know about something to want to buy it; that is having awareness.  In a purchase intent survey, all of the respondents who answer the question know about the product/service from the stimulus presented.  That means your respondents to the survey have 100% awareness.  There isn't a product or service on the planet that actually has 100% awareness in the real world.  Most companies would be ecstatic if it was 70% of their target audience and most have way, way less.

So your math in converting purchase intent results to revenue has to be adjusted for the percent of your target who has awareness of it.  There is a big debate about whether it is better to use "aided" or "unaided" awareness.  Unless you are absolutely sure you have an 'impulse buy' item that is distributed in a highly visible way at its point of distribution, please use "unaided" awareness in this calculation adjustment.

### Find It

To buy it, you need to be able to find it; what is and where is your item's "Distribution"?  In the world typical of Food/Drug/Mass Merchandise products, this measurement is done with an [ACV (All Commondity Volume) measure of distribution.](https://mobileinsight.com/what-is-all-commodity-volume-acv-why-brands-care/#:~:text=ACV%20stands%20for%20%E2%80%9CAll%20Commodities,a%20specified%20region%20or%20territory.)  This sounds fancy but just think of it as a way that one accounts for the fact that all stores don't have equal traffic or eyeballs going through their aisles; it adjusts distribution for consumer count.

The basic math is straight forward in that you adjust for the percentage of stores that care your item if that is how you distribute it.  If you sell on-line you don't need to adjust this because they see and buy your product sort of side-by-side.  If your item is in only 10% of stores, you can knock 90% of the volume off your prior calculation to get your answer.  To be fair, there are some potential reasons for modifiers on this adjustment.  For example, if we know your buyers from confirming direct research say they will visit several stores to find it, you might not knock it down as far; but rememeber the 'lie factor' before you get carried away.  You also see products being very clear right in their advertisements with statements like "Can be found at..." when they have low overall distribution.

## Simulated Test Market

You can put all these parts together, even uniquely tuned to your product/service market situation, in what is know as a [simulated test market (STM)
](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/37225)  What the actual STM development adds beyond the purchase intent measure is volumetric scaling. This means the ability to project the survey findings into to an estimate of contracts, revenues, and total profit.  The STM tool will relate survey findings to market demographics and network geographic information in this projection process.  The result will be a prototype database with a simple to use “what if” front-end that will allow performance scenario estimates to be projected and refined.

The real advantage of a Simulated Test Market model approach is that you can run scenarios.  You might adjust the target segment you are going after.  You might adjust which state or states you will be doing business in.  You might look at how your [advertising plan time alignment might be adjusted.](../business/admath.md#time-alignment) You might look at how your [price elasticity](../business/priceelasticity.md) interacts with your purchase intent scores to fine the volume optimization point.  You might look at how your [Cost of Goods Sold (CGOS)](../business/cogs.md) plays out against your price point to find the profit optimization point.  We have even built models where market-by-market, store-by-store distribution build by calendar date has been modeled and aligned the subsequent [Trade Sales Force](https://www.ksolves.com/blog/salesforce/salesforce-trade-promotion-management-and-implementation) objectives via their [incentive compensation plans.](https://www.anaplan.com/blog/complete-introduction-incentive-compensation-sales/#:~:text=Incentive%20compensation%20is%20a%20form,team%2C%20or%20the%20organization's%20success.)

## Example Methodology

The specific methodology is adapted to the product/service situation, market segment, and the additional measures needed in the Simulated Test Market modeling design. The model logic should be developed in protype before the survey research collection itself.  You want to take mock output data from the survey data management plan output and test drive it for the analytics of the model.  This needs to be totally buttoned down because the expensive part is collecting the survey data and you probably won't get a second chance.
