# Key Performance Indicators

There are loads of things that are used as [key performance indicators for various functional elements of an organization.](https://kpiinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/The-KPI-Institute-KPI-training-infographic.jpg)  With apologizes to the psychologist, HR, management types who have found some way to wedge themselves into organizations, too much of this stuff fails to pass the test of contribution to actual performance.  What you fundamentally need is <font color=yellow>'CLARITY of Business Objectives'</font> and then to work through your organizational structure for how each role must acheive certain things to <font color=yellow>Accomplish their component contribution'</font> to the whole.

KPIs should be ...

- clear and unimbigous expectations
- measurable
- date/time explicit

You should also be able to pretty clearly show how the individual, department, division, component goals relate to the broader organization goals.

Since the goals are to be date/time specific, you ought to have checkpoints on calendars.  Annual performance reviews should be simple; a talley of the checkpoints that isn't a surpise to anyone.

All that said and done, in a well tuned smaller organization or department, there is no reason you can't have the whole team sit for coffee each morning and review what they said they got done the prior day and what they will get done today.  That shouldn't be intimidating at all.  It should allow you to easily ask for help, adjust progression, and stay interlocked to dynamic market situations through effective interpersonal team coordination.
