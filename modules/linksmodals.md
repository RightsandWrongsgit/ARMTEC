# Links & Modals

## [Linkit module](https://www.drupal.org/project/linkit)

The [Linkit module](https://www.drupal.org/project/linkit) claims three main advantages over traditional linking:

1. The user does not have to copy or remember a URL
2. If a URL alias of a link changes, the link still works
3. It provides configurable information about matching links in the autocomplete
 
The good news is it has the same "look and feel" as the core linking.  The autocomplete, the Token support, settings adjustments by profile, and integration with configuration synchronization makes it comfortable to use. 

`composer require drupal/linkit`<br>
`drush en linkit`

## Entity Embed Links module

[The Entity Embed Links module](../modules/entityref.md#entity-embed-links) may be an alternative for integration with Drupals Media Management.

## Field Group Link module

So you can have the whole group you established set up to allow a link.

`Composer require drupal/field_group_link`<br>
`drush en field_group_link`

## Linked Field module

Just linking an individual field.

`composer require drupal/linked_field`<br>
`drush en linked_field`

## Iframe module

Control how you open a linked site; as a frame within yours or as a separate browser tab.

`composer require drupal/iframe`<br>
`drush en iframe`
