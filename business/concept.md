# The Concept 

## What is a Concept
<br>
• A simple one or two sentence expression addressing how the consumer will benefit from the product/service, and reasons why they may believe the product/service will satisfy their needs.<br>
<br>
• It identifies the important unmet need the product will satisfy i.e. how will the consumer’s life be meaningfully different having used this product/service?<br>
<br>
• A concept is strategic in nature.  It establishes a product’s/service’s POSITION IN THE MARKETPLACE.<br>

<br>
## Key Components of a Concept
      
- Accepted Consumer Belief<br>
        -- Defines the issue on which the product will capitalize<br>
        -- A statement about the category/service about which the reader will immediately and instinctively identify<br>
        -- Often referred to as the “Head-nod” or the “Hook”<br>
        -- It can be logical, rational, emotional, etc.<br>
<br>

- Benefit<br>
        -- Also known as the “Promise”<br>
        -- It is in response (the Answer) to the unresolved Accepted Consumer Belief<br>
        -- The single-minded pay-off for the consumer<br>
        -- The reason to succeed in the market (the DISCONTINUITY)<br>
        -- The core of your strategy<br>
<br>

- Reason to Believe<br>
        -- Why the consumer should believe the benefit is deliverable<br>
        -- It is the path of consumer understanding that ties everything together ([value ladder](../business/ladder.md))<br>
        -- It can be technical in nature, authoritative in nature (respected endorsement), systems oriented, physical characteristics, etc.<br>

## How Do You Build Concepts?

• Build concepts yourselves, incorporating resolutions to unmet needs<br>
• Build concepts multi-functionally<br>
• Build concepts with internal review boards<br>
• Build concepts with external review boards<br>

## Presenting To Customers

### Focus Groups
• Initial refinement usually takes place in Focus Group Setting<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        1. Allows for building and laddering among respondents<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        2. Allows for development of “consumer language”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        3. Allows for quick consensus - positively or negatively<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        4. Allows for defensible positioning<br>
      
• Will often incorporate a “triage” approach<br>
• With refinement, will move to ONE-on-ONEs<br>

<br>

### One-on-one
Focus groups are a good way to get quick, somewhat diverse inputs and feedback.  Even a skilled moderator has a hard time managing 'group think' and a dominant few piercing the bubble on otherwise good ideas.  So watch out and try to run several groups in multiple areas with differing mix of prospective customers.
<br>
The other thing that focus groups often miss is the deep thoughts, the personal thoughts, especially on any more sensitive or complex concepts.  So one-on-one interviews once you have brought increasing focus to your concepts is often advised before finalizing to a quantitative test of what appear to be the best.

### Quantitative Study
The use of formal scoring and the gathering of associated demographics that aid targeting are real values of next going to a [quantitative concept test](../business/conceptquestions.md).<br>
