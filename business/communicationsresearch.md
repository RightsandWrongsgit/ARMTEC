# Communications Research

## Summary 
Advertising effectiveness can be increased by a research program where:<br>

  - The creative is based on sound strategy and target audience consistent with market learnings. 
  - Clear and appropriate objectives and action standards are set prior to testing. 
  - The target audience commercial evaluation base is defined by campaign objectives. 
  - The research recognizes that different advertising works differently, and where action standards are adjusted accordingly. 
  - Early evaluation takes place to allow for refinement based on the test finding. 
  - Multiple measures are used which: 
    - reflect objectives; 
    - acknowledge complexity of the communication process; 
    - synergistically support each other.
<br>   
    
 Marketing and marketing research recognize technique limitations. 
  - Copy research is used as input to judgment, not as replacement. 
  - MRD personnel are involved early in the copy development process. 
  - Ongoing campaign tracking is conducted, with early feedback mechanisms in place.

### Advertising Claims:
In the communication of benefits that a product delivers, it is often advantageous to make specific claims of performance. These may take the form of a taste preference, a dominance of use or dominance of endorsement statement, an efficacy claim, etc. Such claims must be supported. Efficacy claims are often supported with scientific evidence such as cure rates or specific symptom reduction for a pharmaceutical product. Ethically, practically, and legally, other claims must also very often be supported with a similar level of scientific rigor. As such, the exact nature of the claim is also critical to clearly delineate in advance of the supporting research design. Therefore, it is often common to first conduct research on the perceived benefit which potential purchasers attribute to a variety of potential claim statements. For example, is "9 out of 10 doctors recommend…" as powerful an endorsement as "The number one choice of doctors". To be effectively supported by research, claims must clearly define the scope of the market definition or competitive set being referenced, they must delineate precisely to who the claim is being attributed and the action that they are attributing (e.g. used by doctors and recommended by doctors are different attributions), etc. Advertising claims research is highly impacted by network television standards, by formal and informal regulation, and by case law; therefore, which the Research Standard on Advertising Claims can provide additional guidance, it is very important to involve GMIR and the Legal departments early in this area.
### Performance - Copy Testing:
It is critical that once you have defined the product offering at an appropriate price, that it be presented to the potential purchaser in a manner which will result in sales generation. This requires that the message elements effectively communicate the basic proposition that is often captured first in the concept testing stage of development. In the concept, the features of the offering are communicated in words that are also commonly translated to benefits that the potential buyer would hope to derive through purchase. Their interest in making the purchase is influenced by how well they perceive these benefits as able to satisfy their needs. These needs are often strongly influenced by the core values that they hold important. Linking features/benefits/needs satisfaction/core values is often aided through a research technique of value laddering. The effectiveness of communication is often challenged by its ability to maintain these linkages in an appealing way expressed through both copy and graphics. Communications research can be involved in guiding this effort in the form of rough copy development guidance to finished copy testing to finished advertising performance measurement. See Research Standards for Copy Testing for additional detail.
### Performance - Placement:
The best advertising communication is ineffective if it is not delivered to a relevant potential purchaser. Quality advertising can be substantially guided by effective Copy Testing. Such testing is carried out against the audience who has demonstrated purchase interest, typically from concept testing results or through household panel data for existing, in-market products. This audience is most commonly described demographically and often further qualified with additional data on psychographics or values. Further, for existing products, and even for new products that have clearly defined competitive products, the readership or viewership characteristics of likely purchases can be found through services such as Simmons or MRI panels. The types of profiles which are created from these demographic, psychographic, and media habit portrayals is used to guide the purchase of media to place the copy in front of the most relevant potential purchasers.   
### Direct Marketing - Overview:
The area of direct marketing poses special demands in communications research. The creative development and finished copy are similar in many regards to the same principles as Copy Testing research. However, copy testing research has traditionally emerged in a "broad media" context where the message and graphic elements are balanced to cast a net across a large group of potential consumers; being solid in message but tempered enough to not disenfranchise. With direct marketing, the placement is very targeted so that the message elements can be further focused to the specific needs and values of the target. This tighter creative opportunity makes direct marketing advertising very effective against the intended target but also raises real challenges for the researcher and direct marketing practitioner. At some point, individualization of message runs into economic constraints; sooner for direct mail, next for Internet page, and finally for phone conversation. Performance in increasingly targeted direct marketing moves quickly from a Copy Testing/Placement orientation to one of in-market experimentation with incorporation of feedback measures in the execution itself. Then, where that experimentation shows particularly good or poor results from on-going norms, follow-diagnostic research on the communication may be utilized.
### Direct Marketing - List Management:
As discussed in the Direct Marketing Overview on Communications Research, special challenges exist in this type of media for both creative customization or individualization and for placement targeting. Placement targeting typically takes the form of list management; although this is often more broadly defined than simply list purchasing for direct mail. Sources of names for targets might come from purchased mailing lists, from in-bound phone contact files, from Internet site registrants, from on-pack or other coupon redemption's with consumer specific information, etc. The research question which often exists is the initial identification of effective targets before a new campaign can be developed with appropriate internal feedback loop measures. Therefore, it is of extreme importance that traditional market research methods be modified to recognize this emerging need. It is typical for market research instruments to utilize a battery of demographic profiling questions at the end of a survey or to use them in a screener at the beginning. To aid list management purchase and selection decisions, it is critical that the structure of the questions and response codes being used in the market research are done as closely identical as possible to the field name and code definitions on list source data files; this allowing an appropriate matching of results to the forward steps of direct marketing program execution.

## Copy Research 
This document outlines a broad-based copy research philosophy. While the scope and focus is primarily television creative, this should not be interpreted as a de-emphasis on testing other media vehicles, particularly "print." In many campaigns, print is the only or certainly an important element of the media plan. Too, with its capacity to convey messages in greater detail, print is often a crucial adjunct of TV in a total campaign. Therefore, it deserves the same testing diligence as applied to TV commercials.

This document begins with the assumption that a proven copy strategy is in place, and that the focus of the copy research process is the systematic evaluation of alternative executions against the strategy.

As such, this copy research philosophy acknowledges:
  - The difficulty of understanding what constitutes effective copy. 
  - An emphasis on diagnostic support of multiple evaluative measures. 
  - That copy research is not a single-number system. 

The objective of copy research is improved productivity by increasing the likelihood of an execution accomplishing its strategic/tactical objectives, by generating relevant information on performance versus objectives, and identifying potential refinements to the advertising as appropriate.

It is important to note that copy research, as discussed in this document, is not strategic research. The copy research process serves two roles:
  - Developmental/diagnostic, defining the "why/how" of an execution's performance. 
  - Evaluative 
    - Effectiveness, focusing on "does it work"
    - Efficiency, "how well" does it work 

A key issue of copy research is to predefine how we expect a creative execution to work. This requires the setting of clear and measurable action standards prior to testing.

Once defined, we can measure it with appropriate and differing tools, placing differing emphasis on the measures based on objectives and action standards established prior to executional testing.

We want consumers to understand, feel, and accept something about our product that is relevant and hopefully unique.

The greatest learnings come from the use of copy evaluation techniques against a broad range of truly different creative alternatives. These learnings are often maximized by the early evaluation of rough copy, where the state of production finish is appropriate to the communication issues at hand.

Copy evaluation is not a single-number system. The function is best served by focusing on wisdom and understanding and not on data for data's sake.

This requires a conceptual framework of how advertising is expected to work against the consumer.  

A useful conceptual framework assumption is that advertising works by:
  - Generating awareness, 
  - Providing relevant, convincing communication 
  - Affecting attitudes 

Each must work together to produce a balanced creative effort which captures audience interest, maintains involvement, and allows communication to occur. The desired result is a positive attitude shift in favor of the advertised brand. This positive attitude shift represents the current state-of-the-art approximation to actual direct measurement of consumer behavior, as direct behavioral measurement is often not practical.
This synergy is at the heart of commercial development and of the problems/opportunities encountered. It is also at the heart of determining if a copy evaluation system is meeting its action standards.

A comprehensive copy evaluation system must address a number of distinct, yet related areas:
  - Affective emotional response (diagnostics) 
  - Memorability/impact (recall) 
  - Copy communication (message conveyed) 
  - Persuasion (motivation to purchase) 
  - Campaign tracking (build, image impact, wear-out) 

<br>

Such a system provides a consistent, relevant framework against which hypotheses can be tested, execution compared, and hopefully improved.
The tonality of an execution, that is, the "tone of voice" as typically defined in the strategy statement also needs to be assessed. In many cases, this component will be key in deciding the degree of executional finish required for testing purposes.
The measurements that constitute a comprehensive system include:

<br>

### Affective Emotional Response (Diagnostics)
  - Viewer response profiles on feelings impact and communication comprehension 
  - Verbatims 
  - Qualitative sessions 
  - Comprehension and reaction tests 
Basically, have we made the viewer "feel" anything? This response is optimally evaluated as a separate component outside the traditional day-after recall methodology, which cannot devote sufficient breadth or depth to a full understanding of the issues.

### Memorability/Impact (Recall)
  - Related recall is predictive of advertising-caused brand awareness. 
  - Related recall is an efficiency measure, creating the opportunity to be effective, but not necessarily the determinant of an effective, successful commercial when the action standard includes the need for positive attitude shifts. 
  - Awareness is really two distinct dynamics, related but separate from each other.

<br>

Matching research to communication objectives recognizes that non-verbal, visual, emotional messages are difficult to evaluate via direct questioning since they don't impact that part of the brain that deals with verbalization.
  - This places emphasis on indirect measures of attitude and the desired net effect of advertising-persuasion. 
This points out the great weakness of the "strategy -" recall -" communications" school of copy evaluation, and explains why persuasion can and does occur without corresponding playback of sales message elements or high recall.

### Copy Communication (Message Conveyed)
Message playback should always be evaluated against the copy strategy and pre-established communications objectives. Two areas are particularly useful in defining copy communication further:
#### Rich verbatims should be characterized as conveying an integrated understanding and involvement with the intended selling message on the part of the viewer. The valuation is not based on "lots of words" or a literal execution playback. 
#### A Verbatim Content Analysis with an objective of understanding how the parts fit together, and the level of involvement and relevancy should be conducted. Specific areas to look for include: 
  - Narrative playback 
  - Message element communication 
  - Brand registration/integration into the storyline 
  - Evaluative comments about the product and the commercial itself 
  - Dominance of executional elements over the desired sales message

<br>

The goal is the development of an integrated point of view of communication effectiveness versus objectives. An integrated Point of View should include an understanding of the following elements where appropriate to the execution.
  - Unique point of difference 
  - Brand integration into the verbatims' storyline 
  - Audio/video sync 
  - Real end benefit 
  - Relevancy of the message 
  - Focus on product 
  - Smooth flow 
  - Confusion 
  - Mnemonic effectiveness 
  - Intended messages should be clear 
  - Unintended messages should not be present 

<br>

### Persuasion Represents the Critical Measure in a copy evaluation system.
  - Differences in persuasion result in corresponding differences in sales/trial rate for established and new brands. 
  - The higher the persuasion, the higher the sales/trial. 
  - The higher the persuasion, the greater is the sales elasticity to media weight. 
  - The lower the persuasion, the lower is the sales elasticity to media weight. 

<br>

The ideal system recognizes that one of the objectives of advertising is to bring a brand into a consumer's consideration set, if not produce a direct change in brand preference. However, the prime focus should be on developing persuasive copy at the highest persuasion level possible.
Persuasion is impacted by structural, as well as by strategic factors: For example
  - Category brand loyalty. High switching categories produce higher persuasion scores. 
  - Number of brands in category. Few brands competing for non-loyals produce higher persuasion scores. 
  - Brand franchise size. The larger a brand's market share, the lower the absolute persuasion score due to fewer consumers available to switch. 
These factors should be controlled for in any persuasion system. Brand user analysis would be evaluated as dictated by the nature of the copy objectives in a manner appropriate to the issues.
It is recognized that techniques to measure persuasion are controversial. The company will participate in efforts to validate existing techniques and to explore new methodologies as they develop.

<br>

### Campaign Tracking
Campaign tracking should be conducted on an executional pool once on air. This component deals with several aspects of the communication process not normally handled by copy tests; specifically, the long term, longitudinal and cumulative aspects of an ongoing creative campaign. This phase is oriented toward awareness build, imagery development, and campaign wearout issues such as awareness decay where media weight is factored into the evaluation.
Such tracking can be an integral part of a division's overall research planning; thus, for cost effectiveness, it can be incorporated with a general category knowledge base that is a resource for future planning and strategy development as well as a specific campaign's ongoing impact.
A copy research system is really a modular framework. It is positioned as flexible, with appropriate phases determined by issues at hand. It is not designed to make copy evaluation simplistic.

#### Copy Research System Components for each objective should include for consideration:
Purely diagnostic techniques such as a communications lab, Clucas, or qualitative sessions. Evaluative/diagnostic techniques such as communication and reaction (C&R) tests, ASI APEX Persuasion, ASI Recall Plus, or ARS.

#### When to Test
Changes in strategy or major campaign shifts always require testing prior to airing. Issues subject to the exercise of judgment regarding when the need to test exists include pool-outs and rough-to-finished execution comparability. The key point is that change requires discussion of the potential impact to the totality of an execution's performance and may necessitate copy testing. 
As a result, the marketing research staff should have input into discussion on the issues of when and how to test copy.

# Implications for Copy Evaluation 
##### Prior to testing, set objectives based on how advertising is expected to work and evaluate accordingly.
##### Both Persuasion and Recall are necessary 
  - Persuasion
    - Effectiveness
    - Prime Screen
    - Higher rough/finished correlation 
  - Related Recall 
    - Efficiency 
    - Necessary, not sufficient 
    - The measurement that is best at rejecting inferior executions rather than identifying superior executions.
##### Communication must be fully understood 
  - Message element coding 
  - Verbatim content analysis 
  - Both affective and rational elements need to be understood
##### Copy evaluation is most effective against a broad range of alternatives
  - Continuous copy development to maintain superior brand advertising 
  - Meaningful differences between/among concepts/executions 
  - Finish appropriate to issues
##### Monitor competitive advertising in major categories as affordable
  - Normative base development/appropriate standards of comparison 
  - Strategic planning/opportunity identification. (Strengthen copy if weaker than competition. Invest behind superior copy.)
##### Track Campaign Effectiveness
  - Persuasion build-from consideration set to brand of choice as a brand moves up the persuasion hierarchy 
  - Imagery/awareness tracking 
  - "Wearout" evaluation
##### Business Building
  - Implement media weight tests behind high persuasion copy only. To go with less heightens the risk of an unsuccessful test result. 
  - Maximize media efficiency via top quartile related recall goal. There must be strong, valid judgmental reasons supporting airing of a commercial scoring below the top quartile of the accepted normative scale.
##### Action Standards
  - Appropriate goals should be set and standards applied to all evaluative measures of recall, persuasion, and communication that encompass an execution's entirety. 
  - The primary purpose of copy testing is not simply to make a "go/no go" decision, but rather to ascertain how a commercial might be improved, that is, to provide guidance to commercial development and execution that will enhance the potential for success. This implies that copy testing will be conducted in a framework that permits this to occur. For example, scheduling of copy testing will allow for application of results, i.e., to improve the commercial prior to airing.
