Take the first step to success with ARMTEC today!  You will find welcoming references to the many tools we use ourselves.  We help you learn business, financial, operational, tactical approaches and the technical tools to support your efforts.  Get straightforward help now!  

ARMTEC is a huge supporter of what are known as "[Open Source](book/opensource.md)" tools.  People volunteer their time to build things that the public has free access to.  In exchange, you  donate time, resources, or what you can back to the Open Source community.  You don't have to compete with some rocket scientist programmer building tools.  This could be a great way to showcase your writing skills while providing value to people who are struggling with certain topics.  It's 'ok' if you are just a good at making complex topics easier to understand.  In fact, you are probably just what Open Source software developers need...

["Free software is suffering because coders donâ€™t know how to write documentation", The Next Web, June 2, 2017
](https://thenextweb.com/news/free-software-is-suffering-because-coders-dont-know-how-to-write-documentation)

Also, you don't always need to think of every Open Source tool as a giant, full fledged software system; although many are.  The way ARMTEC looks at it is that there are also big 'opportunity gaps' on where to find stuff and how to put the many parts together into a meaningful whole.  This site is offered to help you do that!

Most would expect 'Open Source' to apply just to software and maybe extend to online information systems or developer applications.  ARMTEC aims for a broader perspective in the tools provided here.  Key things related to effectively running a business or organization are also presented.  Revenue projection, Profit & Loss (P&L) statement analyses, Advertising & Proprotion (A&P) performance, Market Research, Customer Relationship Management, and more are part of our foundation.  Therefore our technical tools in these areas may be of interest to a broader community shared in an open source manner.

During my hunting through examples on [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/drupal) and many other places, I often wished there was a succinct set of current annotated code samples explaining how to do things the [Drupal way](https://events.drupal.org/neworleans2016/sessions/drupal-way-philosophy).  Of course, there is the excellent [examples module](https://www.drupal.org/project/examples), which is very handy. But this book is designed to otherwise fill that gap. Please forgive the `todo` items, but I've found that if I want to get it perfect, it won't ever get published. 

You are invited to contribute (in the open source way) by making edits and pull requests in [github](https://github.com/selwynpolit/d9book/tree/gh-pages/book).  There is a very simple editor in github which automatically forks the repo and lets you type your changes directly in your browser in [markdown format](https://github.github.com/gfm/). Try it by editing a chapter of interest to you.
