## Cost of Good Sold/Cost of Services Sold

Probably the most traditional way a company hopes to make more profit is via a product or service they can make for less and sell for more.  We already noted industries like software and pharmaceuticals that  fundamentally resell intellectual property over and over again.  There are other pretty interesting ways to pay little and sell for more.   For example, if you can find what is fundamentally waste from one industry and figure out a way to cost-efficiently turn it into something others will pay well for, you have a business.  Power plant scrubbers produce a waste material that might be used as gypsum like material in plasterboard if you don't run into a [Chinese Drywall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_drywall) issue with the captured sulfur.  People who happen to have owned a sausage company figured out how to take the skin or rind layer of the pigs and turn them into a [fishing bait business](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/17/sports/outdoors-the-lure-of-pork-rind.html).  Others source [recycled materials to make furniture](https://everydayrecycler.com/eco-friendly-furniture/).


## Cost-Value

Too many businesses look at what they offer as being driven by technical feature.  The classic example is allowing engineering, cost accounting, or procurement to drive the nature of the product/service.   It would be pretty hard to argue that soda is 'engineered' at anywhere near the level of the quality of what milk offer yet [soda consumption is double that of milk](https://www.manufacturing.net/operations/blog/13190185/americans-drink-more-soft-drinks-than-water-more-beer-than-milk#:~:text=Jun%2027%2C%202011-,According%20to%20Advertising%20Age%2C%20Americans%20drink%20more%20carbonated%20soft%20drinks,milk%20for%20the%20third%20spot.).  I am not saying that the American consumer is 'valuing' the right thing.  However, understanding what [attributes of a product or service are most and least desired is important to understand](../business/needgap.md).   In optimizing the performance of your business or organization, you also need to know more than just the valued attributes but how best to [talk about them in a motivating manner](../buinsess/valueladder.md).  Assuring your offering delivers a valued promise is important to achieving the best price and the leverage of [price elasticity](../business/priceelasticity.md) advantage will nearly always trump the small percentage gains from cost cutting.  In fact, often cost cutting will hurt your performance by weakening a valued attribute or projecting a cheap image.
