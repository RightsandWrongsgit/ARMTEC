# Open Source Solutions

There are a ton of great tools available for free.  Some of these are locally installed software and others are provided remotely through your browser.  Those noted here are ARMTEC favorites.   Please keep in mind that Open Source should gain your contribution to the community if you find you like and use them; and that contribution doesn't have to be just technical.


## Office Suite:

You may already have something from Microsoft or Apple that you got when you bought your computer.  These are great.  There is an open source alternative Office Suite for documents, drawings, spreadsheets, database, and even for formulas that you might want to use.

## Design Your Site:

It is pretty much standard practice to design your first website using some sort of easy tools before you start actually programming it.  You might go through this in steps with increasing levels of sophistication.  A napkin at the bar isn't off the table as a first level option.  Pencil and pad are pretty easy to rough something out and change.  You might move to a drawing tool in your Office Suite to make something to show others and get a first reaction.  The pictures your use in your mockup might come from free internet images, your own camera, or illustrations you do.  Here are some options to look at -
