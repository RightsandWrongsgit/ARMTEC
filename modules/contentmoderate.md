# Content Moderation & Workflow

Check it before you roll it out might be the simplest definition; but [Wiki takes it much further.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_moderation)  In that sense Drupal has an option right on the form where you are inputing your content to 'publish' or leave what you have put in as 'unpublished'.  You might think of this having a number of purposes.  You might get interrupted while doing a draft.  You might be preparing a bunch of new content to have it go out on a publication schedule.  You might have an 'overseer' like an editor, supervisor, big boss, who has to bless it before it goes out.  Heck, you might even be taking in 'user input' and have some sort of review you do before you post what they submitted.

The most current versions of Drupal have substantial [Content Moderation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/content-moderation/overview) capabilities built right into it.  So your first set is just clicking the above link to make sure you know what is in Drupal Core.

If you think about the examples ways one might use content moderation, some of them might benefit from something beyond just 'published' and 'unpublished' status.  If your immediate supervisor, the section editor, the legal staff, the editor & chief, and the publisher all potentially need to review some controversial article you wrote about the town billionaire before it goes out, you probably have some sort of workflow for that process to occur.  Drupal Core also has included some powerful [Workflow Management capabilities you should review and consider.](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/workflows/overview)
