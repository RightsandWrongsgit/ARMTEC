# Need Gap

Need Gap research is a quantitative study that typically follows ideation and qualitiative study inputs.  From your technical development possiblities and/or from prospective customer feedback, you have a good number of attributes that you could include in your product or service.  You have reviewed the competitive landscape and know both what appears to be common basic requirements in the category plus what things you believe you can uniquely provide to differentiate your product.  However, putting things into a product or service incurs costs and you want to make sure you focus on those things that are most valued.  

You need to come up with a comprehensive list of attributes.  The example below, on a 'kitchen appliance', only presents a very abbreviated list of attributes so you can see how survey questions are assembled from them.  You should have 3 or 4 times that many if you really breakdown the full scope of a potential offering at a really detailed level that guides decision making.  Do NOT combine attributes on the same line; each should be individually presented.
