# Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

Using Drupal is like any other website tool.  Your website's success can depend a lot on the traffic it receives.  Sure, there are sites where visitors are arriving simply because it is listed on your business card, in a mailer, via a landing page link, etc.  However, these days search engines play a big role in traffic to most sites.  Unlike in the past, simply hiding a bunch of terms in the pages via a font color the same as the background color won't get you a high score.  You will recieve dividends for unique, original content.  You will recieve bonus points for other sites linking to yours; so you might do some business development contacts to strike deals with logically related referring websites.  There are also modules that Drupal has available which aid SEO performance.



### Metatag Module

No need to hide them; they are part of the metadata for your site that you will see if you 'inspect content' with your browsers's developer view of a page.    This [video on installing and configuring the Metatag module](https://www.webwash.net/getting-started-with-metatag-module-in-drupal/) will help you get the most out  of it.   The control provided gives you access to global, page specific, even user related detail with an inheritance logic.  The fact that it also uses the [Token Module](https://www.drupal.org/project/token) brings the power of even tapping the variables present through out your website as metatags.  The module even goes further in providing flow control to share specfic content with social media sites.

The [Simple XML Sitemap Module](https://www.drupal.org/project/simple_sitemap) is how you will do this for your site and create an XML formated map needed to do this.
