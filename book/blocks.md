# Blocks


## Block Visibility Groups module
#### Enhancement to control and placement of blocks

You can put the [Block Visiblity Group module](https://www.drupal.org/project/block_visibility_groups) in the "greater than sliced bread" category!  Think of website building as putting chucks of things in different areas for display.  You probably already know this relative to 'Regions' that your theme includes.  People who have used an older approach called Panels also know about moving chucks of stuff in different parts of a region.  Drupal from version 8 forward rallys around the use of Blocks for the term of what these chucks are called; and if you use the GUI drag-n-drop Layout Builder function included in Drupal Core you also know how moving the blocks around is pretty cool.  You also may know about how in the 'Administration/Structure' menu in your Drupal site building system you can look at a Blocks Layout Page you can see on what content type and region blocks appear.  But sometimes you want those blocks to show up conditionally; say for a logged in user versus a stop-by.  See this [quick video on how the Block Visibility Group module adds conditional control in a very simple, comfortable way.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKwkaMUbJIs)
