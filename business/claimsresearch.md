# Advertising Claims 

## What are Claims

Making statements about your product or service is simply part of advertising.  As discussed in the [Advertising and Promotion](/business/adpromo.md) section of this site you see that [Positioning](/business/positioning.md) 

## Are Claims worth making?



# General Guidelines 


The following general guidelines should be understood and followed in all communications when stating a product claim.
##       Falsity:
All employees must be acquainted with the elements of the Lanham Act, section 43(a) regarding falsity. Therefore, the following key elements must be understood.
Section 45(a) of the Lanham Act prohibits falsity:
"Any person who, or in connection with any good or services... uses in commerce any ... false or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading representation of fact, which —in commercial advertising or promotion, misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities, or geographic origin of his or her or another person's goods, services, or commercial activities, shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that be or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act"
It includes any false misrepresentations, partial truths, failures to disclose, and false impressions.
It also includes any statements that convey a false impression through innuendo, indirect intimation, or ambiguous suggestion that has a tendency to mislead or deceive the consumer.
The Federal Lanham Act prohibits advertisers from falsely describing their products and allows competitors, but not consumers, to sue.
 
A checklist for Interpreting the meaning of ads:
a)       The FTC can decide the meaning itself, but it has to consider surveys and other evidence of meaning if there are any.
b)       Some claims can be assessed on their face, others require a look at extrinsic proof. 
c)       An ad can be literally true yet imply false meanings, but the commission should avoid injecting novel meanings into ads.
d)       Ads are judged by their effect on reasonable people, but if an ad has two meanings, one true, one false, the ad may be condemned.

## Comparative Advertising Claims:
Comparative advertising that names a competitor's product is legal but risky. If there are good business reasons for doing it, the risk may be well worth taking. Competitors shall be fairly and properly identified. The identification must be for comparison purposes and not simply to upgrade by association. However, when making such a decision, several issues should be considered. First, the FTC believes that comparative advertising, when truthful and non-deceptive, is a source of important information to consumers and assists them in making rational purchase decisions. On the other band, the FDA states that comparative claims will ordinarily not be permitted in labeling, but will be allowed in advertising. However, all promotional claims must be consistent with and not contrary to the approved labeling for the product
Other points to consider include: (a) the First Amendment affords no immunity to comparative advertising that exceeds the bounds of truthful advertising, (b) state false advertising, defamation, and disparagement laws can also be applied to comparative advertising, (c) there are no strictures on the use of a competitor's trademark as long as it is used non-deceitfully.
 
Major issues involved in determining whether comparative advertising claims are legally permissible include:
a)       the need to consider what the audience actually perceives when exposed to such an advertisement
b)       the need for research to support explicit ad claims
c)       the need to consider bow the format, style, or layout of a particular comparative ad can affect the judgment of its legality under the Lanham Act
 
Advertisers will refrain from disparaging or unfairly attacking competitors, competing products, services or other industries through the use of misrepresentations or claims, direct or implied, that are false, deceptive, misleading or have the tendency to mislead. Therefore, speak of competitors with care.
The advertising should compare related or similar properties of the product, dimension to dimension, feature to feature, or wherever possible by a side-by-side demonstration. The property being compared must be significant in terms of value or usefulness of the product or service to the consumer. The difference in the properties being compared must be measurable and significant. Ban dangling comparisons.
Pricing comparisons may raise special problems that could mislead, rather than enlighten, consumers. For certain classes of products, prices may be extremely volatile, may be fixed by regulation rather than the advertiser, and may not only differ from buyer to buyer but from time to time within the same region.
When a commercial claim involves market relationships, other than price, which are also subject to fluctuation (such as but not limited to sales position or exclusivity), the substantiation for the claim will be considered valid only as long as the market conditions on which the claim is based continue to prevail.
As with all other advertising, whenever necessary, substantiation may be required to be updated from time to time where the need to do so is indicated as the result of a challenge or other developments.

## Trademark Laws:
The Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988 will allow a manufacturer or publisher to sue an advertiser that misrepresents in an ad the nature or qualities of the manufacturer's product or publisher's magazine. Competitors must respect the personal and property rights of others.
There are no strictures on the use of a competitor's trademark as long as it is used non-deceitfully. However, copyrights and trademarks must be carefully observed.

## Reasonable Person:
The FTC will interpret ads from the perspective of the "reasonable" person within the target audience and provided some case-specific guidance. There remains a dearth of information about bow the FTC interprets an ad. The establishment of interpretive standards would serve the public policy goals of objectivity and consistency.

 
## Promotional Claims:
Quickly resolve all disputes with competitors, consumers, and the government.
Regulate own advertising. Watch what is said and shown about the product. Aggressively defend the company's products.
All promotional claims must be consistent with and not contrary to the approved labeling for the product
Substantiate product claims; avoid puffery or inflated claims. As soon as you move into the area of an objective or competitive claim, research must substantiate it
Testimonials must be backed by research. Reference may be made to the results of bona tide surveys or research relating to the product advertised, provided the results do not create an impression the research does not support. Written materials used to promote products should contain only statements that can be proven.
The service or product must be shown exactly as the consumer buys it-in all material respects.
Advertisers should deal affirmatively with the results expected from the use of the product or service, not dwell excessively on the results of failure to use the product or service. (NBC)
Health Care Insurance, in particular: Monitor advertisements of medigap policies.
Curb the flow of misleading information and the flow of overlapping and unnecessary supplemental policy sales to older persons.

## Deception:
Regardless of the intentions of the advertiser, an ad campaign for a product, service, or idea is deceptive only if the mistaken actions of purchasers or purchase influences cause injury to consumers or unfair losses to competitors. Be sure the general impression is truthful: by what the consumer thinks is said. A deceiver is an advertiser that innocently, negligently, or maliciously sponsors a deceptive advertising campaign.

## Guarantee and Warranty Offers:
Whenever the terms "guarantee," "warranty," or similar words that constitute a promise or representation in the nature of a guarantee or warranty appear in an advertisement, certain additional information concerning material terms and conditions of such guarantee or warranty offer must be clearly and unambiguously disclosed to the consumer.
 
In general, any commercial announcement in which .a guarantee/warranty is mentioned should also disclose:
a)       The nature and extent of the guarantee. 
b)       The identify of the guarantor. 
c)       The manner in which the guarantor intends to perform. 
d)       Information concerning what a purchaser wishing to claim under the guarantee need do before the guarantor will perform pursuant to its obligations under the guarantee. 
e)       Where applicable, whether a warranty is full or limited.
 
This disclosure may be made so that it will not be misunderstood by the typical viewer.
Simultaneous disclosure in both the audio and video and print often proves to be the best and most certain method of achieving full, clear, and effective disclosure. However, a commercial announcement using only audio may constitute clear and conspicuous disclosure because of the clarity and completeness of the representation and the non-distracting manner of the presentation. Video disclosure alone may not necessarily satisfy the above criteria.

## Direct Sales:
All such advertising must be in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local laws and shall be reviewed with special care. The reputation and reliability of the sponsor and the supervision exercised by the advertiser over its sales representatives are important considerations. Each proposed advertisement is evaluated on a case-by-case basis to insure its acceptability.

## Unacceptable Commercial Presentations, Approaches, and Techniques:
a)       Claims or representations, direct or implied, which are false or have the tendency to deceive, mislead, or misrepresent
b)       Unqualified references to the safety of a product, if package, label or insert contains a caution or the normal use of the product presents a possible hazard.
c)       Appeals to help fictitious characters in supposed distress by purchasing a product or service.
d)       "Bait and switch" tactics which feature goods or services not intended for sale but designed to lure the public into purchasing higher priced substitutes.
e)       The use of "subliminal perception" or other techniques attempting to convey information to viewer by transmitting messages below the threshold of normal awareness.
f)         Unacceptable products or services promoted through advertising devoted to an acceptable product. 
g)       The misuse of distress signals. 
h)       Disrespectful use of the flag, national emblems, anthems, and monuments.
i)         Direct or implied use of the office of the President of the United States or any government body without official approval.
j)         Newsroom settings and techniques.
k)       Sensational headline announcements in advertising of publications prior to the identification of sponsor.
l)         Scare approaches and presentations with the capacity to induce fear.
m)     Interpersonal acts of violence and antisocial behavior or other dramatic devices inconsistent with prevailing standards of taste and propriety.
n)       Damaging stereotyping.
o)       Unsupported or exaggerated promises of employment or earnings.
p)       Presentations for professional services which do not comply with applicable law or ethical codes.
 
Research and Documentation Guidelines

Research and Documentation Guidelines
The purpose of the following guidelines is to assist in designing effective advertising claims research with the objective of achieving reasonable consistency in claims documentation, as well as insuring that advertising containing such claims is responsibly produced and disseminated.35 Advertising claims research should be designed to anticipate criticism and withstand external challenges to a degree beyond that expected of most research.
 
I.  The Review Process
Advertisers are asked to submit copy detailing the claims they intend to make. Written substantiation is requested for all statement of fact (puffery excepted). Claims deemed by networks (and several of the larger print media) to be inadequately supported must be revised.
An advertisement may be challenged by competitors or consumer groups. Each of the major networks has informal procedures or guidelines for bearing complaints. Although it is possible to obtain a bearing without it, challenging arguments are almost always accompanied by research documentation.
Networks are able to take challenged commercials off the air almost immediately. They have done so in the past, although they are understandably reluctant to do so. Instead, they may require modifications in the form of "supers" to be inserted along the bottom of appropriate frames.
The National Advertising Division of The Council of Better Business Bureaus (NAD), a self-regulatory group founded by the advertising industry in the early 1970's, also reviews, commercials.
NAD obtains compliance by publishing its decisions in a monthly case report disseminated to industry members and to the general public. Since advertisers are loath to appear recalcitrant in public, most abide by its decisions. Those who do not may appeal within the NAD to the National Advertising Review Board, a specially summoned panel of business, academic and consumer experts. Decisions by this group are also published.
As with the television networks, the NAD expects the challenges and responses it hears to be well documented, and is competent to conduct a thorough evaluation of the material submitted.
Research designed to be submitted at federal regulatory hearings or in court is exposed to a different kind of risk because it is ultimately judged by persons with little or no research training. It is possible in these situations for research findings to be accepted or rejected for reasons which cannot be anticipated, or for reasons which to a trained researcher may seem unwarranted.
II.  Basic Issues 
A.      Face Validity Vs. Intrinsic Validity
Because research findings are frequently judged by persons trained in other disciplines, the issue of face validity is very important Face validity refers to research which "looks" valid on the surface, particularly to those who are not trained in research methodology. Structured questions may look as though they are getting at the substance of an issue, but may in fact contain language wbich leads respondents to a particular conclusion.
Research protocols and questionnaires should rather strive for intrinsic validity, which is the ability of a test to actually measure what it purports to measure. Evidence of intrinsic validity is not always available in survey research. Citations from professional literature, however, in which the same procedures were used by recognized experts with similar results can be helpful to demonstrate intrinsic validity.
B.     In-house Study or Independent Supplier
Another issue to be resolved early in the documentation process is whether to rely on internally conducted studies already on hand - possibly carried out with other objectives in mind, and before advertising claims were written — or to retain an independent research firm to design a study expressly to address the matter in contention. (In-house research is that which is designed and analyzed by BCBSF, although it may be sent to an outside supplier for field work and data processing.)
 
III.  Wording of Claims
Since context can determine how a claim is interpreted, the following is intended to serve as an overview for various claim types:
A.        Claims will be interpreted according to their plain meaning and grammatical context. 
B.        Claims should accurately reflect the survey questionnaire.
1. The wording/phrasing of a claim supported by an attribute measure should closely correspond to (match) the item on which the claim is based.
2. If a claim is made that "A is better than B" without reference to how or why A is better, the claim should be consistent with analysis of relevant product attributes. Relatedly, a win on one or two attributes is insufficient support for an overall preference claim.
IV.     Guidelines Specific to Parity or Superiority Claims
A.   Parity claims
1. Since the absence of statistical significance is sometimes incorrectly interpreted as evidence of product parity when, in fact, that outcome is best ascribed to insensitive testing, BCBSFs MR/BA department will carefully scrutinize methodological detail.
2. Large sample sizes, a minimum of 500, are suggested.
3. Side-by-side comparisons made at centrally located testing sites are preferred.
4. Results should reflect an equal split of respondents expressing a preference between the advertiser's and competitor's products.
5. If results directionally favor the competitor, a 2-tailed statistical significance test at the 90% confidence level should be conducted. If the competitor has a statistical win at this level, it indicates parity may be a result of a small sample rather than true product equivalency. In this circumstance, a parity claim is not supported.
B.   Superiority Claims 
           I. A minimum of 300 respondents is suggested.
2. Results between the advertised product and each competitor should be statistically significant at 95% confidence, 2-tailed test
3. A statistically significant proportion (95% level) of the total sample must prefer the advertised product
V.     Methodology 
A. Sample
Before drawing a sample, the universe must be clearly defined and its relevance   established. This can usually be determined directly from advertising content In defining the sample, it is also important to include not only those current users of the product but also those who may potentially do so.
1. Unless a regional claim is intended, the sample should be representative of the state population.
2. The sample should be representative of all relevant product users. In ensuring proper demographic balance, the statistical precision of probability sampling is widely recognized by judicial bodies.
There are a number of situations in which probability sampling is not feasible. In these situations, convenience samples have been accorded some degree of acceptability over the years. Since such samples are subjected to greater scrutiny, however, it is recommended that before deciding to employ this method, its use is justified on the basis of factors other than    mere convenience.^
3. The determination of a sample size depends on the amount of sampling error that is tolerable.
4. Respondents should have experience with the product category.
5. Data defining the usage patterns of the respondents should be collected.
6. Unit market share should be represented in the total sample. An exception to this would be for a claim such as "Even the users of Product B prefer the XXXXX of Product A."
B. Choosing Appropriate Competitor Products
1. Leading brands should be identified on the basis of current year-long unit market share data.
2. If a claim encompasses the entire category, at least the top 85% of unit share should be accounted for, but this is entirely dependent upon share data configuration. For some product categories, the 85% rule may be too restrictive while in others it may be too lax.
3. Where possible, like variations should be compared.
To build some degree of stability into convenience samples, it is suggested that a minimum of 10 to 15 geographically dispersed markets be used. If results in a majority of them agree with results among the total population, the total sample results can be used with greater confidence.
C. Test Design
1. The test protocol should be relevant to the product category and to the intended claim.
2. Test products should be treated fairly and similarly.
3. No potentially biasing information on the product should be given to participants prior to evaluation.
D. Questionnaire Design
1. The extent of questioning, along with question wording and sequence, are extremely important As to the extent of questioning, it should be kept simple. Each question should bar directly on study objectives. Open-ended questions which have not been standardized should be used only with discretion. Such questioning frequently encourages the opposition to examine the verbatim testimony closely, and to expose study directors to extensive questioning as to a respondent's state of mind.
2. The two most common types of consumer testing used in documenting advertising claims, as well as in challenging them, are brand comparison tests and communication tests.^
3. Tab plans should be considered before finalizing the questionnaire to insure that the proper data are collected and in such a way as to provide the necessary report requirements.
4. If special multivariate techniques are to be used, insure that the proper design is used and that the questionnaire/instructions are sufficient to guarantee that the respondent is capable of answering the questions fully and accurately.
5. Paper Questionnaires:
a) Printed questionnaires should be printed in a format that allows for the accurate entry of data.
b) All closed end questions should be precoded, e.g., five-point rating scale should be assigned codes 5,4, 3, 2, and 1.
c) Card columns may or may not be required, depending on the type of data entry system used.
6. CRT Questionnaires: All necessary consistency checks and skip patterns need to be integrated into the CRT programs.
7. No sponsor identification
8. No leading questions
9. It is preferred that monadic ratings on product attributes be made in addition to the general overall preference item.
10. Study participants should be aware that they need not indicate a preference.
11. Answers to previous questions should not provide cues to answers to subsequent items. 
 
E. Editing (paper questionnaires)
Each questionnaire should be edited to insure that the right questions are asked and that the proper answers are recorded. This includes:
1. Edit prior to data entry
2. Eliminate answers that are illegible and incomplete;
3. Eliminating answers that are improperly recorded;
4. Objectively deciding single responses is dual answers are shown, and
5. Using a "no response" code where appropriate.
6. If correct responses are not obvious from the questionnaire, then responses should be coded as no answer or the questionnaires should not be used or returned to data collection.
F. Coding
1.       Before coding, a representative sample of the questionnaire should be reviewed to set codes.
2.       If answers may vary by cell (city, user group, etc.), then be sure that questions are pulled in their proper proportions to develop codes.
3.       If the code book is developed from a prior wave, insure that the prior wave code book is still acceptable.
4.       Coders should not individually and independently set codes. A senior person should review codes. It is advisable to establish a standard cut-off for "all other" codes and follow this practice consistently from question to question and project to project. The client should have the option of reviewing the codes before they are finalized.
5.       Make sure that the codes are acceptable to software/hardware packages.
6.       Consistent coding for "none," "no answer," "don't know," and "zero" should be followed.
7.       Code abbreviations used in computer tables should accurately reflect the essence of the code. 
G. Data Entry
For reference, each questionnaire should be numbered. 
Paper questionnaires should be properly batched, so they can be easily referenced for cleaning. 
Both paper and CRT questionnaires (coded responses) should be verified using different data entry operators. It is advisable to inform BCBSF as to what percent of the data have been verified. 
Data entry operators should not make decisions on codes or data entry. These decisions should have been made for them prior to data entry. 
A way to account for "no answers" should be used. This may be by coding "no answer" or by the system automatically showing "no answer" when no item is entered. 
H. Data Cleaning
1.       All questionnaire data should be cleaned to specifications.
2.       Normal look-up cleaning would check for missing key data and inconsistent answers to questions.
3.       When looking up questionnaire data, if answers were either recorded improperly or were missing, answers should not be inserted for the respondent, unless there is enough evidence elsewhere in the questionnaire to warrant the change (e.g., respondent name used to fill in a missing sex code).
4.       Force cleaning, which is done by having the computer change all the answers meeting certain criteria, should only be used when changes are logical, is advisable to make the BCBSF aware that force cleaning is being used and the circumstances under which data are being changed.
5.       A clean data file should always be prepared before starting to tabulate the data.
6.       If any tabulations or marginals are run with "unclean" data, make sure all printouts clearly indicate that "non-clean" data are being used.
7.       In order to avoid the possibility of double-counting the same respondent, a respondent's data record should never be duplicated in any way.
8.       Verify that no duplicate cases exist in the data. This may appear to obvious, but because of the way files are sometimes managed on a computer system, they must be consistently audited to verify that cases have not been copied into a file more than once.
9.       Cleaning specifications should be written for all information collected by computer assisted interviewing systems. The programmer who designed the questionnaire may have made errors that were not detected during the interviewing process.
10.   A data back-up system must be used to insure that the possibility of losing data is at an absolute minimum. This entails daily storage of files that have been created or modified since the last back-up was done.
11.   Storage of backup files should be a very stable medium. 
I. Tabulation
Tabulation specifications (tab plan) are designed by the Researcher and communicated in writing to the programmer. 
These specifications should be discussed with the end user of the tabulations before programming begins. 
Banner specifications should be most carefully reviewed since these are used in defining every table in a particular set of tabulations. This eliminates unnecessary costs and delays. 
Tabulated data should accurately reflect findings from the questionnaire. 
All tabulations should be checked against topline reports before they are released to the end user. 
A sample of summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc.) should be calculated by band or through a separate computing system to verify their accuracy. 
Computer-generated tables should be checked against the marginals to verify all bases and all responses. 
All tables should clearly indicate the response base, whether it is total respondents, respondents meeting certain criteria, or any other base, such as total units or households. 
If significant testing is shown on tables, the table should be properly annotated to show the significance level, type test, and relevant assumptions on minimum sample size above which testing was done. 
Cells with less than 0.1% should appear differently than cells that have no answer at all. 
All tables should show the base line used in percentaging, even if percents only were requested. 
If a rounding algorithm is used to make percents add up to 100%, they should be footnoted accordingly. 
When means are shown, the standard deviation and/or standard error should also be shown, unless BCBSF specifically requests otherwise. Means for grouped data should show the basis for weights within each group. 
If data are weighted, weights should be fairly and consistently applied. 
Weighting should only be done with full knowledge of the client Weighted data should carry a notation to that effect 
J.  Data Analysis 
Statistical Significance While significance levels are a matter of judgment common practice in advertising research is to report significance at not less that the .90 level of confidence. It may be appropriate to adopt a higher level in some cases (e.g., preference tests which are directly linked to comparative advertising claims). Also when documenting that preference does not split 50-50 in such tests, it is appropriate to report significance on a two-tailed basis. This practice treats the data conservatively, taking into account that reviewing agencies are not usually shown the advertiser's prior research. If relevant prior research exists and its results are disclosed along with those of the latest test, one-tailed significance testing in the later test may be appropriate. 
See above and Appendix 
3.       Recognizing that a "no preference" response is fundamentally different from one in which a particular preference is opined^ the "no preference" category should not be assigned to either or both preference groups.
4.       To ensure overall results are not heavily weighted by one group or another, analyses should also be conducted for appropriate demographic groups.
