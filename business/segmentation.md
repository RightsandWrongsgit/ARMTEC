# Structure & Segmentation

If you got here as a skeptic around this crazy segmentation stuff, at least consider basic structural segmentation.  Know who the buyers are of the category you are selling into and their relative size is terms of sales impact.<br>

If you might be more open to Market Segmentation being important, consider some key reasons.  For all intents and purposes, when we examine our [market potential](../business/potential.md) we drill into some sort of localization of our market to tighten our targeting and increase the efficiency of our advertising and promotion.  However, the "WHO ARE YOU GOING TO TALK TO" part of segmentation is really only the first level benefit.  Remember, the most powerful lever of profitablity is really [how persuasive your communication is](..//business/admath.md#persuasion-scores).  Therefore, we also want to aim to gain from segmentation addressing "WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY" and "HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SAY IT".

Lets look at an example where we have identified five attitudinal segments. From our [value ladder](../business/ladder.md) world, they seek higher level benefits from the use of our product or service.  Some seek fun, others speed, still others efficiency, etc.<br>

That value ladder painted a picture of how we might emphasize certain message positioning and then support it with underlying features as reasons to believe our story.  That is great, however, before we start developing list sources and targeting methods to reach and deliver the focused message to the right segment members, one of the first things we want to know is just how prevalent each segment might be.<br>

If we wanted to position the message element supporting "fun" as the lead our mapping of which reason to believe support point would suggest emphasis of the "style" around our product feature.<br>

Looks like the "speed" seekers need a strong package insert documentation along with just the basic feature being called out.  And we make sure the copywriter doing the documentation knows to emphasize the speed of how easily we get going with our product, how fast it is to maintain it, how quickly we get the job done using it, etc.<br>

The "endurance" seekers aren't at all surprisingly most focused on the "quality" of our product as we call out features around 'reasons to believe' the message directed at them.<br>

Looks the the "effiency" seekers are true to their basics; "don't give me a bunch of wrap around stuff, lets focus on the core features of the widget itself.<br>

Ok, so I might sort of buy into all this craziness.  But are attitudes about really basic things all that different?  Like why should I [value ladder](../business.ladder.md) when my product is a health solution?  Doesn't everyone just think their health is important that that is enough for me to talk about?  Think again their oh skeptical one!  Some people focus on food/diet as the definition of how they think about health.  Other people are all about exercise.  Some just think about what to avoid and they will be health; like stop smoking and pour one less beer.  Still others just throw their hands in the air and think their health is preordained by their genetics and you better thinks about softly treading you message if that is your target segment.<br> 

<img src="../business/captures/segmentation4.png"  width="500">

Yeah, yeah, so health is multifaceted.  But I have a simple food product which is just one of those health circles so I am done right?  Think again there ole swamy!  So you must be in the well, illness, feed good segment area about food; "you eat just to prevent illness (scurvy), and as long as you don't burp it up (digestive) you are happy".<br>

When we looked at [market potential](../business/potential.md) we started with a geographic example about the differing level of prevalence of asthma to broadly segment our market by region of the country with higher incidence of asthma.  We moved through state, county, and zip code geographic segment targeting with consideration of the incidence, our own brand penetration, and even competitive price differential to further pinpoint opportunity.  However, since we noted that it is [persuasion](../business/admath.md#persuasion-score) as the strongest profit performance lever by making our [message relevant and different](../business/needgap.md), lets finally look at how we bring this additional step into the prior targeting approach. 

Let's assume we did a value [ladder](../business/ladder.md) for our fictious AsthmaFix product.  Let's assume we have a [list source](https://www.leadsplease.com/) that claims to have an index which scores interest in health.  We have done our survey of AsthmaFix brand awareness along with both a [purchase intent]() score and a battery of high level [emotional reward and personal value](../business/ladder.md#a-continuity) attributes. And, of course we collected brands used along with their buying frequency to calculate AsthamFix [penetration rates and market share](../business/potential.md#penetration-&-share).

We bring these facts together and we discover that the low market penetration we reported relative to awareness may NOT have been the result of a low level of media plan spend and exposures; but could likely be a result of people not having their 'ears up' to our historical pattern of  selling "health" as the positioning message for AsthmaFix when most of the market first thinks of their asthma in terms of its higher level impact on their energy, performance, serenity, and even appearance.  Shift our message to these and we are likely to engage the market more directly; [stopping power and persuasion](../business/needgap.md) because they hear relevance regarding something they value as important
