# The Creative Brief

It is typical to work with an advertising creative agency in the step from taking your [positioning summary](../business/positioning.md) to the development of different concepts to make it ready to use in advertising and promotion.   You may plan to reach your intended target with television, print, digital, sales literature/script/consulting selling responses, sky writing or who knows.  It helps to have a fresh set of eyes on your story to consider alternative ways to 'say it' or 'tell your story' in a most persuasive manner.  Advertising agencies employ artistic, and copy/story telling talent specifically charged with being creative.  That's the good news and you want it.   However, somehow you also need to prepare these talented people with enough background to contribute most effectively.  You do that with something called a "Creative Brief".  Here is an outline of one to fill out.  Keep glancing back at your positioning summary, [need gap](../business/needgap.md), and [value ladder](../business/ladder.md) as you fill this out.<br>

## Prompt me

Questions to ask yourself to assist in writing a complete, inspirational and smart creative brief.

#### PROJECT:
    • What is the overall objective?
    • What issue is holding you back from reaching your objective?
    • Why is communication needed at this particular time?
    • What is the role for advertising?
    • What is the communication challenge?
    
TARGET:
    • Who is the most valuable audience?
    • Who is the most impressionable audience? 
    • What are the most insightful things we know about them? 
    • What are the things they are talking about related to this market?
    • What do they believe before we tell them anything?
    • What are their cultural influences?
    • What do you want people to say about your brand? 
    • What is their shared emotional need or desire the brand can best address?
    • Are there particular moments when their thoughts and feelings are strongest? 
    • How do they think and feel about the category? 
    • How do they feel about our Brand? 
    • What are the moments of truth? Is there a particular time or event that propels the category or the Brand to top of mind for the consumer? Is it a negative moment (which we can turn to our advantage), or a positive moment we want to leverage? Some of the most impactful work an agency does has been developed around a moment of truth. 
    • Why aren’t they (the target) doing what we (you and the client) want them to do?
    • What attitudes must we establish or change?
    • What habits do we want formed? 
    • How do our current customers find us?
    • When, where and under what circumstances will the target be most receptive to the message?
    • What music do they like?
    • Who are their friends? 
    • Where do they play?
    • What motivates them, frustrates them or makes them laugh?
    • What kind of house do they live in?
    • What keeps them up at night?
    • How do they behave as users, are they more a scanner or scroller or clicker or explorer or browser etc.?
    • Are there any secondary audiences? What is important to the secondary audience? 
     
MESSAGE: 
    • What do we want our audience to feel? 
    • What do we want our audience to do? 
    • What is the best starting point to achieve our objective/solve our challenge? 
    • What is the brand's ambition?  How do we convey it in this instance?
    • Why hasn't it achieved that ambition already? 
    • How does the competition conventionally try to address/communicate the same issue? 
    • How do we disrupt that convention?
    • What is the most relevant and differentiating idea that will surprise consumers or challenge their current thinking of the brand?
    • What's the consumer/industry insight that would drive us to think differently? 
    • Does the proposition have meaning, truth, and promise? 
    • The question shouldn’t be “What can we tell the consumer to persuade them to buy more,” but rather “How can  we help our customer?”
    • What's the brand's "safe" area?  Use that as an anchor and try moving out from there.
    • If you could get one sentence through all the clutter, what would that be? 
    • What is the psychological, social or cultural tension associated with this idea? 
    • What makes our target tense about the idea? Cultural truths are always moving, so tensions are everywhere. The most interesting tension needs to make you squirm a bit. 
    • What is the question we need to answer to complete this assignment? 
    • Who else is competing for our target audience's attention with similar or related messages? How are our  messages different to theirs? 
    • How do we think this will get people talking about the brand?  
    • Why might they talk about this idea? And how do they get involved?
    • Will this generate publicity for the brand? 
    • What level of participation do we want or need? 
    • What's in it for the target; why would they want to participate?
    • Have we made it as easy as possible for them to participate?
    • How will it be remembered and retold?  
    • What are we really selling to our customers? 
    • What results are we promising to our customers? 
    • Why should people care? 
    • Is the creative designed to entertain, act as a branded utility, to challenge, to spawn user-generated content? 
    • How will the audience encounter the communication? How might that change from the first encounter to later encounters? 
    • What is the consumer benefit, not what the product is, but what the product will do for the prospect?   Where possible, an end benefit. 
    • What would make a real difference to people if only they knew about it?
