# Groups

[The Group module](https://www.drupal.org/project/group) is a commonly used contributed module that is modern and seems to be well maintained.  It is a good way to offer you site to an organization but parts of it to some smaller groups like divisions and departments.  You might want to make a forum for people who RV but have special groups who use Class A versus Class B and Class C units or even who have different brands and modules where they can talk about their unique units.<br>

There is a good overview of the [Groups module for the creation of Microsites.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ns4SUtyiYFs)  This video will show you the great capabilities you can leverage with this module.
