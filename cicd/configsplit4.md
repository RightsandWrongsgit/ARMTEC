# Which YML files do what

There are also all sorts of additional field, block, form, menu, action, and view related yml files in your configuration.  Most of those are complex enough in interactions among several that direct editing would be pretty risky.  The ones presented below are a little more straightforward.  If anyone feels they would like to include some others, feel free to request an addition to the table below.  If any listed appear to be misrepresented, go ahead and lets us know as well.
