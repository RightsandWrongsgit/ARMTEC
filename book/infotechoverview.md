## Starters

Feeling overwhelmed with technical stuff. Don't worry, we can help you [get started with the basics.](Novice.md)

[Git Version Control](../book/gitbasics.md) is a great tool for saving your work automatically and rolling back to a safe point. Additionally, [Integrated Development Environments](../book/ide.md) can present all the different parts you work with in a more user-friendly way.

Concerned about spending money on software tools?  There are [Open Source Tools](../book/opensource.md) you can use for free and they provide outstanding functionality.

As for remembering everything, we have [links to cheatsheets](../book/cheats.md) that you can consult whenever you need to reference something. And if you still have questions about something that seems too basic, don't hesitate to check out our ["It May be Basic But Sometimes You Need a Boost!" section.](../book/Novice.md)

Remember, the key is to start slow and crawl before you can gallop. Good luck!
 
## Content Management Systems (CMS)

Information technology is more than just the internet. These days most things are there at some level; even if it is just to use the pipes to exchange between remotely hosted sites. It can helpt to think of the Front-End and Back-End parts of applications and tools. The Front-End is what we interact with on our devices, like [browsers.]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser)  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are examples of Front-End tools. They communicate with the Back-End, which handles heavy logic and number crunching using tools like TWIG, PHP, and Python. Behind it all are databases where information is stored. Content Management Systems excel at managing all these levels, making them superior to simple websites.

Lots of the websites you stumble across, especially for tiny businesses, organizations, or individuals just have some images and words in various sizes and locations.  Sometimes they don't even have more than a single page while others have a menu with say half a dozen linked pages.  You ought to [write one of those yourself using HTML](https://www.tutorialstonight.com/html-web-page-examples-with-source-code) as a good way to practice and understand the basics.   Same sort of thing with [CSS which works to make the HTML structure of a page look better](https://www.tutorialstonight.com/how-to-use-css-in-html).  Find more about [free for practice websites here](../book/hosting.md#a-free-static-website-for-practice).

A [Content Management System (CMS)](../book/cms.md) uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, while connecting to the back-end for logic control and database storage. It allows you to create reusable "buckets". In the [Drupal CMS](https://www.drupal.org/) these buckets are called [Content Types;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soQ6N7oVkI0) like an 'article' styles and an 'advertisement' style for a newspaper. This saves time by not starting from scratch with every detail.

## Core Plus

Drupal is the premiere Content Management System.   While Wordpress is used on more sites, the largest or more sophisticated sites of universities, governments, major businesses, etc. turn to Drupal.  A lot of that has to do with security advantages and the scope of flexibility offered by Drupal.  We will let the [advocates]( https://www.digitalpolygon.com/blog/top-benefits-of-drupal) [detail the praises](https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/understanding-drupal/what-are-some-of-the-commonly-advantages-of-drupal).  One worth special mention is that Drupal is what is know as ['fieldable'](https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/api/entity-api/an-introduction-to-entities) for all of its entities, not just those content buckets but things like users or even totally customized components.  

Drupal can be a confusing challenge because of all of its flexibility.  So many people make so many very different things with Drupal that its first installation or 'Core' is stripped to a minimum.  Like think of going to buy a car as start with ordering only the frame, wheels, and engine block; then being asked to install the carburetor or fuel injection system, seats, a truck bed, a camper, side mirrors, etc.  If you bought a car that way it would drive you nuts and you would love it when someone offered you some option packages.  In Drupal you now understand Modulesâ€¦ stuff you add on to core that does things you want.  A list of those Modules you most likely will want are provided in the [List of Chapters](../book/chapters.md#drupal-modules).  Understand these are just a fraction of the tens of thousands of Modules available and are presented just because we find them most useful for projects we have done.


## Build/Host

Drupal code is like any other computer code and sits in files in directories on a computer.  There are a whole lot of files and a whole lot of directories.  A broad [roadmap gives you a feel](../cicd/directorymap.md) and the value of using an [Integrated Development Environment](../book/ide.md) becomes pretty clear.   So where exactly are all these files and directories?  If you have a live, production website they are located at the [Host](../book/hosting.md).

You don't typically use that hosted production website as a place where you directly make changes.  It would be dangerous if you mess something up that your site would be off-line until it is fixed.  Also, it is virtually never that you are a one & done website developer; rather you build, deploy, enhance, redeploy, in a series of improvements over time.  How you do that is using a [Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment workflow](../book/drupalcicd.md) that is provided here.
