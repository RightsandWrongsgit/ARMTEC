# Ad Wear

Does your story get old?  That question is often asked if you have been running an adverstisement for a long time.  The definition of long time may be more about itchy marketing staff than any pure chronology.

This is not a new question.  [Meg Blair](https://themasb.org/margaret-henderson-blair-appreciation/) founded the Advertising Research System (ARS) Group and had pushed work in this area decades ago.  ARS was known for television advertising testing but the question of wear has since moved to be asked in other media.  The general answer is that ads do show a wear effect but not as quickly as most people think.

It shouldn't be surprising that wear has a time as well as frequency component.  Think of it from your own perspective.  If you are watching television some evening and you see the same advertisement several times it seems to get old.  If you saw it three times that night you question it; if you saw it three times over a month you would find it a good reminder.  How about if you see it on television and see a similar cut in an online video on your computer when you click a YouTube training session you enjoy?  Is it too frequent or is it well coordinated as a multi-channel campaign with continuity of message reinforcement?

There is a pretty [extensive set of research](https://people.duke.edu/~jch8/bio/Papers/Kronrod%20Huber%20Ad%20wearout%20IJRM%202019.pdf) that may guide more specifics as we work out campaign plans.  Clearly the importance of using a [campaign planning calendar](../business/admath.md#time-alignment) is evident.
