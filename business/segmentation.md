# Structure & Segmentation

Market Segmentation is important for a number of key reasons.  For all intents and purposes, when we examine our [market potential](../business/potential.md) we drill into some sort of localization of our market to tighten our targeting and increase the efficiency of our advertising and promotion.  However, the "who are you going to talk to" part of segmentation is really only the first level benefit.  Remember, the most powerful lever of profitablity is really [how persuasive your communication is](..//business/admath.md#persuasion-scores).  Therefore, we also want to aim to gain from segmentation addressing "what are you going to day" and "how are you going to say it".

Lets look at an example where we have identified five attitudinal segments. From our [value ladder](../business/ladder.md) world, they seek higher level benefits from the use of our product or service.  Some seek fun, others speed, still others efficiency, etc.<br>

That value ladder painted a picture of how we might emphasize certain message positioning and then support it with underlying features as reasons to believe our story.  That is great, however, before we start developing list sources and targeting methods to reach and deliver the focused message to the right segment members, one of the first things we want to know is just how prevalent each segment might be.<br>
