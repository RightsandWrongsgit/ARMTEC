## KNOWING WHERE YOU ARE -
You want to edit the .BASH_PROMPT file.  The 'dot' in front of it hints that it is a hidden file.  On a Mac you can hit CMD SHFT DOT and it will show hidden files.  Then copy
the code from this link, paste it in and save it.*  (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/master/.bash_prompt).  Next time you open the terminal you should
have a command prompt that shows you a colored two part prompt that indicates first what local subdirectory you are in and second where you on on GITHUB (since you probably
haven't set up and logged into GITHUB yet it probably won't show anything for the second part yet, but trust me, it will later and be very helpful).

* You edit these in a text editor and if you are using the terminal in the apple/mac/iOS system you need to make sure that editor is set up for the right formats.  That editor
will use the keyboard function setting of your operating system and those are set in your “System Preferences” “Keyboard” in an OS system.  There is a tab called “Text” in there
and a box on that tab which, if checked, using “smart quotes and dashes”… Uncheck that box or you will be screwed up because the terminal can’t use that style quote and dashes in
its commands.
