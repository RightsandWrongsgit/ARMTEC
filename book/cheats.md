## Cheat Sheets

<p> When you are doing things with many parts, sometimes you don't remember the details within some element.  This is especially true if you are doing something
  like building and hosting a content management system (CMS) website.  You need to remember things like Git for version control workflows, and HTML commands to 
  structure a web page; then css and js to make it pretty.  What we normally do is put links to these on your computer desktops for handy reference. </p>
