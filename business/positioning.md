# Positioning

Fundamental to communication or even business operation is knowing "who you are".  Or, if a new business "who you want to be".

Since you communicate about your business in a way that you create expectations of a perpective customer, you basically "Make a Promise".   You're graded on how well your and your employees keep that promise in every interaction they have with a customer.  Therefore, what you say should be what you actually do and who your actually are.  It is your <font color=yellow>"Position"!</font>

## Existing Business/Product

Research can be done which attempts to draw from [interviews with you and your employees to elicite the attributes](../business/archetype.md) most endearingly associated with our business selves.  You will subsequently encapsulate that with your product/services description to summary a concept that you will promote.  If you are efficient about it, you will aim to tell that story about your business to those who are most likely to care and thus be pursued.

## New Business/Product

For new products/businesses, the process is similar but focuses on finding what attributes people want and aren't feeling that they are currently receiving; what is their "need gap" and can you fulfill it?
