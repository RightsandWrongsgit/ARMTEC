## OPERATING SYSTEMS & SHELLS -
You probably are on a Mac or Windows, possibly even Linux; these are operating systems (OS).  Other than knowing which one you are using and some occassional differences in how
you do various tasks, I won't review the details of each OS.  There are all sorts of things on places like Wikipedia that give nice overviews and histories.  But one thing
you probably should know is that each of these OS's has something called a 'Kernel' that is like a set of commands that get the computer what to do.  And you talk to the
Kernel with what is know as a 'Shell'.  Again, there are a couple different Shells but they are pretty consistent at their most basic level.  Mac is using 'zsh' but in most
regards it is just a more capable version of BASH; and BASH is generally available across operating systems (if you want to argue that, then you obviously aren't a novice, so
move on).  BASH has some files that can be edited to provide 'scripting' (or a series of commands to be run).  But for use here, all we want to do is to edit your BASH file
that manages what your command prompt looks like (that > or $ typically present when you open a terminal).  If you use a Mac you probably know that your FINDER application shows
you where files are in various directories and on Windows it is something called EXPLORER. If you have worked with those you know you often have subdirectories below 
subdirectories below subdirectories.  With FINDER OR EXPLORER you can visually see where you are when you point to a file.  But imagine you are working just from a single
line like a command prompt on a terminal and you could be lost as to where the heck you are.  Therefore, we are going to start by modifying the BASH file in a way that make
that prompt show you information.  There is something discussed later called 'GIT/GITHUB' regarding your connection to a remote computer and we want to know where the heck
we are on both our local computer and the remote computer.  So the BASH file edit outlined next does both.
