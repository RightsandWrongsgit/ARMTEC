# Architecture & Entities

In the [Content Management System Overview](../book/cms.md) it was noted that a CMS has a database component and a display component where "There is also code in between the data and display that applies any logic."  Some of that logic might be things you code in to do stuff unique to your website; either coded directly or grabbed from a [contributed module](chapters.md#drupal-modules) that has underlying code accomplishing what you want.   However, before all that happens it is being applied to Drupal's Core.  Understanding some of the logic in what Drupal Core is doing can be helpful in using Drupal no matter if you are just working with modules as a site builder or you get under the hood as a developer.

##  Information Types

In addition to the "parts" of a CMS being the front-end, the back-end, and the database, there are different ["information types" in Drupal.](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21core.api.php/group/info_types/10)  The information types might be thought of cutting across all the parts but where an understanding of them is very valuable is between the back-end and the database.  The basic information types in Drupal are:

-  Content
-  Session
-  State
-  Configuration

The [Session information,](https://www.drupal.org/project/session_api) being things like is someone logged in, can be used in how you design or run your system.  This is especially true with things like ['Permissions by Role'](https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/understanding-drupal/users-permissions-and-roles) which Drupal is known to have extraordinarily effective management of in how it works.  Think about what you might show to an anonymous user versus a logged in user, verses a premium paying users, versus editors, and developers; all under your control.   And if what is in Core isn't enough there are contributed modules that take things even further with [Groups or what might be thought of as Departments in your organization.](https://www.drupal.org/project/group)

[State information]( https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/state-api/overview) can be thought of as more mechanical stuff the system itself generates.  Not as likely to be directly used in things you may do unless you are a developer.  Think of it often valuable in relating to 'time'; like when the the cache last updated or [CRON](https://www.drupal.org/docs/administering-a-drupal-site/cron-automated-tasks/cron-automated-tasks-overview) last run. 


[Configuration information](https://www.drupal.org/docs/drupal-apis/configuration-api) is something you care a lot about.  What will happen if you don't do anything with importing and exporting configurations, the work you do in setting things the way you want them as you get started will disappear.  I don't mean your Drupal installation will be gone.  Rather, things like the name you set, the theme change you made, the logo you applied, those will revert back to the default starting point because you didn't really save them.  The basics of saving your configuration are simply to think that what you have done [doesn't get saved until it gets converted into files, something called YML formats, and those making their way into the database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s46oXPDsJ3M)   If you are [using the Continuous Integration and Continuous Development Base Project we provide this configuration management process is set up across our multi-environment workflow.] (../cicd/configatroot.md#you-care-about-this-one-now)

## Content Information Type

We slipped the word 'information' out and this brings focus toward what you will commonly find on the Drupal.org site or basic Drupal tutorials that may find some familiarity.  A standard installation of Drupal has two content types already set up; Article and Basic.  Article works well for things like a Blog or a Newspaper where you want to have a template of common content that will be reused as a shell for lots of additional material.  A Basic content type is more typically used for things like an "About Us" page or other 'one-off' pages as their starting point.

It is key to understand that you can create any number of [Custom Content Types.](https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/hy/structure-content-type.html)  Why would you?  Think of it this way.  Let's assume you are making a website with a list of attractions in your area for people who visit for a fishing tournament you run.   You believe they come a long way and will stay many days before and after the event.  You also know that they often bring spouses who really aren't into three days of fishing.  So you want to present other area attractions that they might consider.  You want to include area restaurants you recommend,  hotels they might consider, nearby museums, shopping, spas, etc.   Do you think that the same information would logically be presented for each of these?  Sure, some information might be like the address, or phone number or website URL.  But would you classify a hotel as 'white table cloth' or 'food truck' or present a 'menu'?  Each of these things you might broadly consider attractions might be presented in a search list of results, pulled forward with a [taxonomy](../modules/taxonomy.md) enabled query but once the user clicks to look at a given item the 'fields' of information they contain would be different.  Seems like you should consider different content types that have fields associated with them which are unique to what should be presented.
