# Events
## The kind you run

Just to make sure you are where you think you are, this page is about how to use Drupal to set up an event website.  There is a whole different page explaining the [Events→Conditions→Actions](../modules/ECA.md) which is a toolset that triggers an action to occur under events and conditions as a set of rules.  

It should not be surprising at all the Drupal has a rich starting point to set up an event website.  This is because Drupal is very community oriented and runs all sorts of events around the globe throughout the year.  Since the Drupal community needs its own websites to manage these events, they have built some really great functionality.

## Event Platform module

You can find the [Event Platform module](https://www.drupal.org/project/event_platform) on the Drupal site.  Use the normal composer method to install the module and drush to enable it.

`composer require 'drupal/event_platform`
`drush en event_platform`
