# Git and Git Respository

### Version Control or Dig Yourself out of a Pinch!

You probably feel like the last thing you need is to learn one more thing in all this computer jargon stuff.  However, you will thank yourself for learning how to use Git and its use with a repository.  You will read all sorts of things talking about its use for 'version control'.  Translate that to the more basic, "Oh no, I just screwed up, how do I get my prior work back?"

Git is the part of this you will put on your local computer.  A Git Repository if hosted on some other computers that you link to as a way to have a copy of your work or code tucked safely away.  You will link your local to this hosted copy of your code and interact back and forth as you work.
