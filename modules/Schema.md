# Schema or Architecture



This is for a documentation outline in site design that emphasizes the value in organizing the architecture of your site; especially if it is likely to be of some level of detail and complexity or size.

Rockowitz outlines the value of doing this:

It is really brought to like with many different content types being used in a site.  And the Type Tray module's way of categorizing and organizing these in a nice visual way it helpful to understand.

Rockowitz moves deeper into schema in this documentation but he doesn't just hang you out in the entity diagram world; rather, he does a nice job in showing links to specific modules that are helpful with things like field type management and use in applications.
