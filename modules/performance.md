- Modules to assure site Performance -


Quicklink (Performance):











































Advanced CSS/JS Aggregation Module (Performance):
Keep in mind you have the basic capabilities as part of Core in your Administration options.  But if you really want to leverage all, this module should jump your frontend performance.














































Search:
Drupal already has basic search built in.  However, if you have substantial content you will improve performance via enhancing modules.  

Search API module:
This is a good basic interface enhancement module to support initial basic search yet be ready to move to Apache Solr search integration.  You will need to do some experimentation in terms of setting it up with the facets module in the more current versions of Drupal.  





















The set up process is relatively complex because of the range of options for what can be indexed.  This video walks you through the process and it also shows about 25 minutes into it how to switch the indexing server to Solr (requiring the Solr Search module to be installed and enabled).  https://events.drupal.org/barcelona2015/sessions/building-amazing-searches-search-api


The main watch out you hear in the video is to remember to manage the access options so you aren't exposing unpublished or other unintended information from your site via people finding it in the search.  Beyond the video, effort must be done around the approach to setting up a solr server in your hosted site container via your DevOp procedures; this is NOT discuss here but should be investigated with your host's documentation.
