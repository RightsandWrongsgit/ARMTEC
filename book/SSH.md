# SSH Keys

Check to see if you have SSH Keys by a) making sure 'hidden' files are showing, and b) looking for an SSH directory under your 'user' directory.  The key will end with a '.pub' but the private key name may be what you gave it when you set it up; like "yourlaptop".

If you don't have an SSH Key set up, it is pretty [easy to do](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) but differs by Operating System.
