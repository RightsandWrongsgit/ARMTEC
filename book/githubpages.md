# GitHub Pages 
## Worth a look
GitHub is primarily discussed here for its importance as a [Git Respository](book/gitbasics.md) for its role in version control in a CI/CD workflow.  However, GitHub is kind enough to also offer a free web hosting of a [static site](book/static).   There are instructions from GitHub and from third parties that are worth referencing.  Two key things that are jumpstarters are that the underlying pages you create will use [markdown]() to put in the content and that you will need to use a [theme]() to make the content work like a website.  Jekyll is a commonly used theme for this purpose and GitHub offers a bunch of templates to get you going with one of those.  You can [fork]() a Jekyll theme and use it directly or modify it to your custom needs; this site is using the Jekyll [Minimal] theme but the forked copy has been heavily customized.  If you are already a fairly skill front-end developer, you can also create your own theme from scratch.
