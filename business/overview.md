ARMTEC, Inc. assists in profitable strategic performance for an organization.  Oddly, that includes ‘non-profits’; the logic being that profit is not a sin but simply a measure of organizational efficiency.  If the organization decides to plow that profit back into furthering its mission, more power to ‘reinvestment’.

The reason we focus on profit is because it traces so easily to an organization’s [P & L, Profit & Loss, or Income Statement](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/accounting/profit-and-loss-statement-pl/).  There is a [good video on how you might look at the percentages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUnifB9Ot90) on a P & L Statement to better understand your business.  While we are not in love with exactly how or the conclusion implied by the video, just seeing the math is a good start.

The broad perspective of the large sections of your P & L is pretty instructive in principle.  Noted are the following areas: 

Revenue (or Sales)
Cost of Goods Sold (or Cost of Sales)
Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) Expenses
Marketing and Advertising
Technology/Research & Development
Interest Expense
Taxes
Net Income


Where the details within each of these broader groups are valuable is understanding what day to day actions are behind each.  If you don’t know what transaction level things are in each group, you look at something called a “[Chart of Accounts](https://www.accountingcoach.com/chart-of-accounts/explanation/2) for the answer.  Here that video offers some general help in regard to how typical businesses put stuff in which bucket; but understand that different businesses follow slightly different practices (and it is perfectly legal).   Also, when we work with large companies, it may not be unreasonable to have a 3-ring binder with how line item expense in one department rolls up to a group at the division level and a higher grouping at a corporate entity level or more at a conglomerate level.  So the engagement diagnostics can become somewhat more time consuming to help provide a strategic solution.

Reflecting back on those large categories, some examples of a basic approach may help understand the basic process to enhance business performance.  And, in some regards whether ARMTEC, Inc. would take an engagement or recommend an alternative approach better fitted to the likely problem.   That line titled “Cost of Goods Sold” relates to a company who makes or resells some physical product.  If a company has terrible and/or slipping cost efficiency in how they are sourcing and making something, if the good involved is generally outside our wheelhouse, it is likely better to work with an industrial engineer who specializes in manufacturing efficiencies to see where [economies of scale](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economiesofscale.asp#:~:text=Investopedia%20%2F%20Mira%20Norian-,What%20Are%20Economies%20of%20Scale%3F,a%20larger%20number%20of%20goods.) might be reached.  
The economies of scale or a product manufacturing savings effort by an industrial engineer does NOT mean ARMTEC, Inc. wouldn’t offer to engage with them.  The reason is that if you want to scale volumes, you also need to understand promotional response dynamics.  If you want to modify a product to save money, you also better know if it impacts a driving choice feature that will crash your demand or a durability change that will change your [buying cycle] (https://www.forentrepreneurs.com/buying-cycle-and-triggers)/[repeat rate](https://www.glew.io/guides/calculate-repeat-purchase-rate).   It is better in these types of situations to work as a mixed team to properly understand the moving part interactions.

If we look at the line for ‘Taxes’ in the expense list above, ARMTEC, Inc. would likely refer you to a tax accounting firm specializing in your industry and likely in your state.  On the ‘Interest Expense’ we might comment on your debt/equity ratio relative to the rest of your P & L characteristics with consideration of risk you should think about.  However, shopping specific brokers, leveraging tax efficiency in rate calculations, and these types of consideration is likely an area we would work with a preferred financial expert.  Where we would work with such an individual is around the area of ‘[Pro forma](https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/what-are-pro-forma-financial-statements.html#:~:text=Pro%20forma%20financial%20statements%20are,may%20occur%20in%20the%20future.) planning to assure they are ‘future thinking’ in terms of any recommendations consistent with your broader business plans.  

## Revenue or Sales Demand

It may sound like ARMTEC, Inc. is talking ourselves out of all sorts of lines in your business.  So exactly what are the areas that we specialize in supporting?  The big one is that ‘top line’ for Revenue or Sales — we aim to help you drive it and that is the most important thing you need your business to do to be successful.  


## Profitable Growth

The biggest areas of concentration tend to be these three:
 
Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) Expenses
Marketing and Advertising
Technology/Research & Development
The logic is this.  Selling, Marketing, and Advertising expenses are short-term and long-term drivers of Revenue trend.   They are relatively large in size.  They are direct levers between expense and revenue.  Using them properly and efficiently is core to driving a growing profit stream; not an expense stream that grows proportionate with Revenue.  Rather, an expense stream that is foundational to ROI from managing their performance.

Technology/R&D are also often key performance drivers that are foundational to assuring features that drive purchase choice are emphasized and technical advancements are not done just for their own sake.  And it is critically important that the approach to spending in this area is closely tailored to the underlying [business model of the organization](../business/busmodel.md).
