# NOVICE: It's 'OK' you haven't memorized this stuff!

### Somethings are pretty basic but if no one every showed you, you might need a quick reference
Most people have enjoyed using their computer via GUI (Graphical User Interface) applications.  Developing your own website, means getting a little  more underneath the covers. It is a little harder than just driving around existing applications on your computer.  You will need to use things like a 'terminal' or 'command line interface' (CLI) on your computer.  This SUPERNOVICE section is provided to give you some guidance in the basics.  We were all there once.  And you know what, we still pop into this very section now and then to get a reminder.

## SETTING UP YOUR BASIC SYSTEM BEFORE YOU GET STARTED
### WITH THE DRUPAL DOCKER CONTAINER 

Flesh these out with more explanation or source links but basically the following (note this is MAC oriented initially, then add Linux and Windows later) ...

* Install Homebrew
* Install Git
* Obtain GitHub account
* Establish SSH Key to GitHub account
* Install Visual Studio Code (possibly via homebrew vscode option)
* Install Composer (see Drupal.org background on Composer for lots of detail: https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer)

Add - Include a quick discussion of how to get to the parts of VSCode to invoke a terminal to issue git/github commands, to bring up the command palette (like CLI) via shift-command-p, and to install extensions (plus what key extensions will really help you get started).
