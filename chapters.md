Selwyn got me started in using GitHub pages for doing extensive documentation.  My original goal was mainly around just the starter CI/CD workflow repository offering greater depth of understanding than just its own readme.  However, Mr Polit's great Drupal 9 Book documention showed me how you might make GitHub pages much more.  Taking advantage of the [markdown format](https://github.github.com/gfm/) I am building in parallel and trying to avoid redundancy with his efforts.
