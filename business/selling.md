# Selling

Even if you don't have a salesforce, skim through this information.  If you do have a salesforce, watch the videos.

Most organizations find that one of the most effective sources of revenue generation is from personal selling.  If not from a salesforce, then from customer service, leadership, and other staff who interact with potential clients.  The key here is that "interact".  Traditional advertising was unidirectional; a print ad provided a message about the product or service and hopefully where to get it.  A personal selling interaction is a dynamic exchange.  Information is obtain and provided.  Knowing the potential client's situation and needs is an important way to align the features or attributes of what you are offering to a solution.  

A good sales person will also know the importance of a personal rapport and engage the client at levels tapping or aligning with their personal values.  If you are familiar with the concept of the ['Value Ladder'](../business/ladder.md) you might think about engaging the selling conversation at the highest level of functional benefits or even at the emotional benefits while conversationally aligning to their personal values.  
 

## Consultative Selling

Consultive selling is a personal selling approach that leverages important conversational skills in the sales process.  At the simplest level thing of it as having the goal of first understanding if the customer has a problem they would like to solve for which your product or service would be a fit.  You really shouldn't be rattling off all sorts of features or even benefits of your product or service as the conversation starting point because that is providing random information of which most is likely not relevant to the prospect.  Rather, have the objective of understanding their situation, goals, and even personal values or desires, then speak with more direct relevance and your message will be heard.

There are a whole bunch of [videos on consultive selling but this one is quick and clear(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwdcDY4lD8c).  It hits these seven process points:

1) Bring Insight.
2) Disqualify.
3) Dig Deep.
4) Know Their Drive.
5) Solve.
6) Use Case Studies.
7) Focus on Next Steps.

To bring insight you really need to do your homework in pre-call planning.  Be prepared to find that your probes on the initial sales content disqualify some of your offerings but align to what does fit.  And dig deep, surface level communication often fails to uncover underlying concerns; thing as if the client is on the analyst sofa and use your personal rapport building skills to probe for full understanding.  The know their drive point is that personal value level of the value ladder engagement you hope to achieve.  Now you can logically offer roues to solve the problem(s) you have uncovered and don't be afraid to story tell with use cases.  The focus on next steps is an acknowledgement that this might be filling out an order but it might also be a follow-up contact to bring back more information.  Let's talk more about this follow up and its fit in your [CRM or Customer Relationship Marketing system](../business/crm.md). 



## Selling Objections

Prospective customers, especially those you might being making just an initial contact with, often raise conversation ending selling objections.  This is where[being curious about your prospect's truths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31OaeexX9RI) by first engaging is a conversation at the gain understanding level of consultive selling is very effective.

You should also be aware that other, [more specific selling objections will occur during the personal selling conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sux18CRotkk).  While that video link is to a sales training company, one critical point being made is to 'map resolving customers objections'.  Good sales training that includes the use of situational selling scenario practice would be to mentally map the most common objections and enhance your on the spot skills to address them.  Many organizations with well managed professional sales forces do this at district meetings each [POA or Plan of Action Cycle](https://www.zendesk.com/blog/sales-cycle/).


## CRM Connection

Now we get to the thing that will really make your salesforce effective and efficient.  It is likely that if you do the math, you will be paying hundreds of dollars to have someone do a personal sales presentation.  And, extend that math to look at the prospective customer 'reach' that is possible with the number of sales people you have on staff.  You are very likely to find you aren't touching even a small portion of your prospective customers and you are not following up with previous contacts in a timely manner to further the selling process.  Yes, think of selling as a process rather than a one-and-done contact logic.  If you were to supplement your sales people with telesales contacts in between personal contacts you are probably extending reach for 10% of less of the cost of a face-to-face sales call.  If you were to send digital or direct mail between telesales or face-to-face calls you achieve continuity of contact with much lower cost.  However, the messages need to be relevant to be effective.  This is where your [CRM system](../business/crm.md) needs to pick up selling objective and other information from your salesforce contact management inputs and share them with the other contact approaches to tune messages.  ARMTEC, Inc. has designed these approaches for sales groups as small as half a dozen to as large as 4,000.


## SG&A Expenses

Sophistication is powerful and can produce effective and efficient results.  However, doing some of these things can push your SG&A (Selling, General, & Administrative) Expenses upward.  So it is important that the approach be developed with careful sequencing but under an overall well integrated plan to provide payback.  Here ARMTEC, Inc. has helped organizations first develop a Pro Forma outline of approach to assure success.
