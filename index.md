### Toolbox

Our [Business Basics](chapters.md#chapter-business-basics) help you understand the drivers of success, the business models with the best profit potential, help with costs, pricing, volume modeling, preparing advertising briefs, and  more.

Our [Effective Communication](chapters.md#chapter-effective-communication) section covers the value of correct positioning, how archetypes can short-cut customer communication alignment, the value of customer relationship management, and how to think about ad wearout. 

Our [Marketing Research](chapters.md#chapter-market-research) elements offer an extensive array of 'how to' solutions.

We even provide a handy dose of [Information Technology](chapters.md#information-technology) solutions. Business analytics benefit from your understanding information technology.  Understanding information technology can be important if you leverage digital media resources in your advertising and promotion.  Don't worry if you aren't a techie.  You  will find our [information technology basics](book/infotechoverview.md) valuable no matter what your starting point.  Soon you will know how easy it can be to create digital assets, landing pages, and how to use a powerful website tool called a Content Management System (CMS).

### CI/CD Workflow
Ok, time for a 'decoder ring'?  Several things can too easily get in the way of effectively developing a great website for your organization.  This may be knowing about the free open source tools that help with pictures, graphics, and even improved copywriting.  Or, it may be that you start on a website and in the middle of it you make a mistake; possibly a mistake where the whole thing vanishes.  Like our tools on how to conduct market research or how to write an advertisement brief, its is all about having a simple template starting point.  Decoding CI/CD is all about that template philosophy in website development.  CI, or continuous improvement (or integration for the purest), acknowledges you start basic but want a course to expand and improve.  CD, or continuous deployment, acknowledges that you can make minor incremental improvements rather than wait for a grand meeting with a grand master website wizard to get things done.  Our Drupal CMS CI/CD Workflow Jumpstart repository actually sets up a base website for you in one of the most powerful web tools out there and integrates it with hosting deployment so your efforts are in market as soon as you want.  Our repository itself is intentionally kept very 'clean' so you can clone it to build your own [Content Management System website that leverages Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment](chapters.md#chapter-drupal-template-with-cicd-workflow).  Unlike some repositories, this one is documented here with instructions, screen shots, and even details on exactly how and why it was built.


The main menu which appears on every page, points to the broad subject areas you might find interesting.  However, the resources are extensive.  So you might want to jump to the list of [chapters which present detailed topics to choose from.](chapters.md)
