#  Claims Research

- Involve Legal from the onset<br>
  - <q>they may advise external arms length after core design work</q><br>
- Always have the specific claim language decided in advance of research<br>
- Ask as few question as possible and only those that will be useful in substantiating the specific claim.  In a legal discovery the questionaire and findings will be looked at and other responses might work to negate a claim.<br>
- Avoid asking open-end.  Responses can be a can of worms and coding is considered highly subjective.<br>
- Any changes to a product nullify existing claims.<br>
- For a "line" claim, all SKUs should be individually substantiated.  Any line extensions launched need claim confirmation.<br>
- Any health related product claim should be reviewed with associated regulatory function.<br> 
- Types of Claims likely...<br>
  - Superiority: claim a higher level of performance relative to competitive brand or earlier formulation<br>
  - Parity:<br>
    - Equality: two product are claimed to be equal in some factor (e.g. <q>tastes as good as X</q>)<br>
    - Unsurpassed: claim is mad that the other product is not better/higher in some way (e.g. "No other product smells as good")<br>
  - Non-comparative/Communication: seeks to communicate a product difference or benefit in general but not comparative (e.g. "Feels Great")<br>
