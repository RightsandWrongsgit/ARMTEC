# Events, Conditions, Actions

One of the most powerful modules for those who are Site Builders rather than PHP developers is the [ECA Module](https://www.drupal.org/project/eca).  You might have a need to do something under one condition but something different under another; a "IF-THEN-ELSE" situation.  Actually, the ECA module handles much more complex and even multi-step Event, Condition, and resulting Action situations.  Plus, it does it with a GUI (Graphical User Interface) where you can drag, drop, select options visually.

[Documentation for the ECA Module](https://ecaguide.org/) goes way beyond what is available on the [Drupal Site](https://www.drupal.org/project/eca).  This expanded documentation has install, and basic usage information but also how the module can leverage permissions, tokens and more.

[A separate library of already set up ECA examples](https://tube.tchncs.de/c/eca/videos?s=1) is even available.  It features videos of how various ECA situations are handled.  Plus, you can often download the ECA example code from these videos as your starting point and edit modifications to meet your specific needs.
