# Which YML files do what

NOTE: There are also all sorts of field, block, form, menu, action, and view related yml files in your configuration.  Most of those are complex enough in interactions among several that direct editing would be pretty risky if you are a pretty advanced Drupal user. If anyone feels they would like to include some of those, feel free to request an addition to the table below.  If any listed appear to be misrepresented, go ahead and edit in your recommended changes.<br>
