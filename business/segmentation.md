# Structure & Segmentation

If you got here as a skeptic around this crazy segmentation stuff, at least consider basic structural segmentation.  Know who the buyers are of the category you are selling into and their relative size is terms of sales impact.<br>

If you might be more open to Market Segmentation being important, consider some key reasons.  For all intents and purposes, when we examine our [market potential](../business/potential.md) we drill into some sort of localization of our market to tighten our targeting and increase the efficiency of our advertising and promotion.  However, the "who are you going to talk to" part of segmentation is really only the first level benefit.  Remember, the most powerful lever of profitablity is really [how persuasive your communication is](..//business/admath.md#persuasion-scores).  Therefore, we also want to aim to gain from segmentation addressing "what are you going to say" and "how are you going to say it".

Lets look at an example where we have identified five attitudinal segments. From our [value ladder](../business/ladder.md) world, they seek higher level benefits from the use of our product or service.  Some seek fun, others speed, still others efficiency, etc.<br>

That value ladder painted a picture of how we might emphasize certain message positioning and then support it with underlying features as reasons to believe our story.  That is great, however, before we start developing list sources and targeting methods to reach and deliver the focused message to the right segment members, one of the first things we want to know is just how prevalent each segment might be.<br>

If we wanted to position the message element supporting "fun" as the lead our mapping of which reason to believe support point would suggest emphasis of the "style" around our product feature.<br>

Looks like the "speed" seekers need a strong package insert documentation along with just the basic feature being called out.  And we make sure the copywriter doing the documentation knows to emphasize the speed of how easily we get going with our product, how fast it is to maintain it, how quickly we get the job done using it, etc.<br>

The "endurance" seekers aren't at all surprisingly most focused on the "quality" of our product as we call out features around 'reasons to believe' the message directed at them.<br>

Looks the the "effiency" seekers are true to their basics; "don't give me a bunch of wrap around stuff, lets focus on the core features of the widget itself.<br>
