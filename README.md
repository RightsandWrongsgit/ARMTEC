GitHub Pages Site: Technical Support Division

This site offers an extensive array of tools used by ARMTEC, Inc.  However, we offer these to the community under the terms of the license noted on the site.  This includes Business, Market Research, common Open Source tools, Novice to Advanced Information Systems explanations, and even guidance on how to use our Drupal Template to more easily get started with a website capable of growing with your needs.

The documentation for a Drupal CI/CD Workflow Base Project is presented here but the code itself is under a separate repository  of this same user account called "initial-test-of-platform-ci-with-lando".  The documentation is separate for two reasons:

- That repository involves support of a multi-branch workflow and it is preferred NOT to have a gh-pages branch underneath it to avoid confusion.

- This separate repository also includes extensive background to support a novice user with basics; either directly, or through provided links on documentation pages.

Enjoy yourself!
