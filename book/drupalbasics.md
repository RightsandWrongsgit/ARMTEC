# Drupal Basics

Drupal is a [Content Management System (CMS)](../book/cms.md).  More sites are done in WordPress CMS but it is possible that Drupal may serve more pages because it is more commonly used on powerhouse websites of governments, universities, major businesses, etc.  If you are building for the future, go with Drupal.  Even if your plans now are small scale, Drupal gives you the better path to grow.  Through use the the CI/CD Workflow](../cicd/cicdoverview) provided elsewhere on this site you have the technical path forward to grow your site incrementally.

Besides the CI/CD Workflow important to securing version management of your site, what makes Drupal super for a growth path is all the [Modules](../modules/modulesoverview.md) you can add to it; like tens of thousands.  With the number of Drupal developers worldwide using this [open source](../book/opensource.md) platform, the range of what is available to you free of charge is phenomenal.   Shown on this website are just a handful of the more important modules that you might want to consider while building and then while maintaining your own site.  The [Drupal organization maintains the master list of contributed modules](https://drupal.org), sort of to see all of them.  The "sort of" point is that you can also [write your own modules.](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Drupal-10-Module-Development-Fourth-Edition) Crazy as that sounds, don't forget you might [just take an existing contributed module that is close to what you are wanting and edit a copy to make it your own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXCK4XPF6E0), doing exactly what you want.

All that is getting way ahead of ourselves.  If you don't know much about using Drupal you want [the basics from a good tutorial.](https://supporthost.com/drupal-tutorial/)  After you skim that, then you want to go try it via a [test drive here.](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/introduction/getting-started/quickstart/drupal)

If we assume you found all that to your liking, then turn to our [CI/CD Drupal Base Project](../book/drupalcicd.md) to get rolling with your own first project.  This workflow uses Lando and Platform.sh as local-host connected [containers.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) One of the key [benefits of a containerization approach](https://www.mendix.com/blog/benefits-of-containerization/) is the simplicity of building, destroying, and rebuilding a Drupal website.  Don't worry, that workflow set up provided does this in a way that stores your work, lets you backtrack to recover from 'mess ups', and makes learning itself also an iterative process.

## Learning Sources

Besides this site itself, there are a ton of resources to learn more about Drupal.  Never one to reinvent the wheel checkout a solid list from [Selwyn Polit's Site.](https://selwynpolit.github.io/d9book/learn)  One he may have overlooked that is real strong is called [WebWash from Ivan Zugec](https://www.webwash.net/) over in Australia; he reviews things with real practical 'how to' depth.  When I was first learning Drupal one of my favorites was the [Code Karate Kid and his 'another daily dose of Drupal' videos;](https://www.youtube.com/@codekaratetutorials) these are somewhat dated at this point but many modules he reviews has current versions worth checking out.  I love how brief they are and wish the new Drupal [Project Browser wish is a better way to find valuable contributed modules](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_browser) would require or at least encourage module developers to provide these type of brief video overviews there.  Perhaps this is your [Open Source Contribution Opportunity.](../book/opensource.md)
