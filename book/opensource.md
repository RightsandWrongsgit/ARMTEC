# Open Source Solutions

There are a ton of great tools available for free.  Some of these are locally installed software and others are provided remotely through your browser.  Those noted here are ARMTEC favorites.   Please keep in mind that Open Source should gain your contribution to the community if you find you like and use them; and that contribution doesn't have to be just technical.


## Office Suite:

You may already have something from Microsoft or Apple that you got when you bought your computer.  These are great.  There is an open source alternative Office Suite for documents, drawings, spreadsheets, database, and even for formulas that you might want to use.

## Design Your Site:

It is pretty much standard practice to design your first website using some sort of easy tools before you start actually programming it.  You might go through this in steps with increasing levels of sophistication.  A napkin at the bar isn't off the table as a first level option.  Pencil and pad are pretty easy to rough something out and change.  You might move to a drawing tool in your Office Suite to make something to show others and get a first reaction.  The pictures your use in your mockup might come from free internet images, your own camera, or illustrations you do.  Here are some options to look at -

## YOU & Open Source

ARMTEC is a huge supporter of what are known as "[Open Source](../book/opensource.md)" tools.  People volunteer their time to build things that the public has free access to.  In exchange, you  donate time, resources, or what you can back to the Open Source community.  You don't have to compete with some rocket scientist programmer building tools.  This could be a great way to showcase your writing skills while providing value to people who are struggling with certain topics.  It's 'ok' if you are just really good at making complex topics easier to understand.  In fact, you are probably just what Open Source software developers need...

["Free software is suffering because coders donâ€™t know how to write documentation", The Next Web, June 2, 2017
](https://thenextweb.com/news/free-software-is-suffering-because-coders-dont-know-how-to-write-documentation)

Also, you don't always need to think of every Open Source tool as a giant, full fledged software system; although many are.  The way ARMTEC looks at it is that there are also big 'opportunity gaps' on where to find stuff and how to put the many parts together into a meaningful whole.  This site aims to help do that!

We believe that Open Source business concepts are just as important as for people as computer code.  While this  site is fundamentally our personal resource collection site, we don't wall off others access to it.  If you find it helpful to 'self serve' your own needs great.  If you find it opens your interest in working with practical experts who know how to help you even further, feel free to contact us.
