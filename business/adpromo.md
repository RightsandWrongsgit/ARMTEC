# Advertising & Promotion

Perhaps the most powerful lever in profitable success is advertising and promotion.  Too many businesses cringe at spending in this area.  You hear the story of how "half of my advertising spend is wasted, I just don't know which half".  That is very sad because your organization likely has something great where you and potential customers are losing out on not knowing about it.

## Premise?

Most people believe there is a relationship between "Advertising" and resulting "Sales".  Obviously this is why advertising and promotion are the most powerful lever of profitablity.  Some would say lack of profitablity if they have had disappointment with prior advertising.  There is a relationship but the fact a bunch of things can go right or wrong with it is why ARMTEC, Inc. is often engaged by clients.

## Overview of Parts

The summary below gives you a quick way to think about what you should consider in planning your advertising and promotion.  The "Right Message" [positioning]() is foundational to telling your story; 'what you say'.  Make sure you are very disciplined in that step.  How persuasive your message is comes from 'how you say it'; think about it as message traction.  Would you respond to "17.35% burn to movement efficiency gain" or "Enjoy great mileage to that next fun destination"?   Is your reaction to that "Well it depends if I was telling an engineer or just a normal driver"?  If you think like that you won't have any problem understanding how the "Right Placement" depends on who you are targeting and if you are placing an ad in an engineering journal or the local newspaper.  "Right time" is ideally fairly tightly managed and also acknowledges the value of an on-going relationship contact plan that a [CRM approach]() provides.  At its most basic level "don't promote your show shovels in June (well, unless you are in the southern hemisphere).
