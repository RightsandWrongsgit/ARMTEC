# SSH Keys

Check to see if you have SSH Keys by ..<br>

a) make sure 'hidden' files are showing,[Mac](https://www.macworld.com/article/671158/how-to-show-hidden-files-on-a-mac.html) [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/view-hidden-files-and-folders-in-windows-97fbc472-c603-9d90-91d0-1166d1d9f4b5)<br>
b) look for an SSH directory under your 'user' directory.

The key will end with a '.pub' but the private key name may be what you gave it when you set it up; like "yourlaptop".

If you don't have an SSH Key set up, it is pretty [easy to do](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) but differs by Operating System.
