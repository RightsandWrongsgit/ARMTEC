# Olivero Theme

Drupal earned itself a bad reputation.  Even if people bought into the point that it is the powerhouse [CMS](../book/cms.md) they were turned off by the initial look of it; a function of the [Bartik theme](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/core-themes-bartik) being from a past generation. 

The world experiences the web with highly graphical beauty.  Heck, some sites seem to offer little more than pictures.  Drupal was built for function and it speaks to the developer community who create performance that way.  Drupal has been on a tremendous update mode for several years now and has learned to speak to both Developers and Site Builders.  That later group probably migrated from trying [Wix](https://www.wix.com/) not really having to know anything but wanting more, rolled through [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) but hit the wall quickly, and has now heard Drupal can accomplish any of their goals.  A new "WELCOME" sign is out with the Olivero theme presenting a clean, modern style while front-ending real functionality.

## This Changes Everything

[The new Olivero theme is something you need to see.](https://imagexmedia.com/blog/drupal-new-front-end-theme-olivero)  The menu flow if outstanding.  The graphic frame is clean.  It has the ability to work with a [Drupal GUI drag and drop tool called Layout Builder.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOM4yRWv7Ew)  Olivero is worth a quick review of its [many features and benefits](https://evolvingweb.com/blog/hands-drupal-10-olivero-new-theme-meaningful-name) before you consider any other alternatives.  Olivero is just the theme part of the recent advances in Drupal.  There are many more; see [The Best Of Drupal 10.](https://pantheon.io/blog/explore-best-drupal-10)

[To really get under the hood and see what a powerhouse Olivero really is, you should hear from its lead developer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dn-JN2bcw1s)  Sure, he gives you some nuts and bolts level things but more importanly he reviews its huge range of features.  When you listen to his presentation please think about if and how any other approach you are going to try to build your own site with is going to handle all these critical things.  [Olivero not only has outstanding navigation and great accessiblity features, its Flexbox deployment provides super responsiveness on devicesThe Making of Olivero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohPaYEbC4Lk); <font color=yellow> Please jump ahead to 19:30 to get to the good stuff on this video.

## Olivero Sub-theme

Normally many themes in Drupal are meant to be further customized using a process called [sub-theming.](../theme/subtheming.md)	 This formally isn't the case with Olivero.  Rather, it is meant to be used directly.  That sort of makes life a little easier in terms of setting things up.  But it makes things a little less flexible for where you might head.  What is behind this is that Drupal is aiming to make things increasingly easy so it attracts more people to use it and is adding to its [theme StarterKit effort.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUAjQ5xKT8)  There is actually something underlying this even deeper and that is an initiative to [automate the Drupal version update process.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp0bVnCs0R8)  Eventually this will make Drupal even more capable of serving the needs of Site Builder.  Still, the underlying architecture wouuld appear to assure continuity with the needs of Developers who prefer independently installed themes that they sub-theme.	
	
People have gone ahead and directly [sub-themed Olivero.](https://designkojo.com/drupal-theme-primer-part-1-creating-drupal-sub-theme)  The risk of doing so it that the Olivero parent theme could change in ways that will break stuff the custom theme relies upon.  Do you take that risk?  Well it isn't an insurmountable thing to go back in and figure out how to fix your custom theme files to work with an updated if you are comfortable in how [TWIG](../theme/twig.md) , [HTML, and CSS](.. /book/opensource.md#front-end) in a priority to backup default flow; then you can trace what broke and just edit it.  Others have also shown how the created an [Olivero sub-theme at a much more detailed level to give you a feel for more of the code level things going on under the hood](https://developpeur-drupal.com/en/article/create-drupal-9-olivero-sub-theme)

If you are simply wanting to have a great theme out of the box give Olivero a shot.  It has a lot of customizations you can do directly and the example sites using that theme show you some.  If you grow in comfort with the underlying front-end tool set of [TWIG](../theme/twig.md) , [HTML, and CSS](.. /book/opensource.md#front-end) you might dare to sub-theme Olivero.  If you are that far along, you might also be ready to head toward the [Bootstrap theme.](../theme/bootstrap.md)  Good news either way, you can switch themes in Drupal very easily in terms of the front-end to back-end connection; might not look pretty right away but that will be all front-end stuff you then will want to tweak.
